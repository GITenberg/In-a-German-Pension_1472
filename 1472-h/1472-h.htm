    <h2>
      1. GERMANS AT MEAT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bread soup was placed upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Herr Rat, leaning upon the table as he peered
      into the tureen, &ldquo;that is what I need. My &lsquo;magen&rsquo; has
      not been in order for several days. Bread soup, and just the right consistency.
      I am a good cook myself&rdquo;&mdash;he turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How interesting,&rdquo; I said, attempting to infuse just the right amount of
      enthusiasm into my voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;when one is not married it is necessary. As for me, I have
      had all I wanted from women without marriage.&rdquo; He tucked his napkin into
      his collar and blew upon his soup as he spoke. &ldquo;Now at nine o&rsquo;clock I make
      myself an English breakfast, but not much. Four slices of bread, two eggs,
      two slices of cold ham, one plate of soup, two cups of tea&mdash;that is
      nothing to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He asserted the fact so vehemently that I had not the courage to refute
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes were suddenly turned upon me. I felt I was bearing the burden of
      the nation&rsquo;s preposterous breakfast&mdash;I who drank a cup of coffee
      while buttoning my blouse in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; cried Herr Hoffmann from Berlin. &ldquo;Ach, when I was in
      England in the morning I used to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned up his eyes and his moustache, wiping the soup drippings from
      his coat and waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they really eat so much?&rdquo; asked Fräulein Stiegelauer. &ldquo;Soup and
      baker&rsquo;s bread and pig&rsquo;s flesh, and tea and coffee and stewed fruit, and
      honey and eggs, and cold fish and kidneys, and hot fish and liver? All the
      ladies eat, too, especially the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I myself have noticed it, when I was living in a hotel in
      Leicester Square,&rdquo; cried the Herr Rat. &ldquo;It was a good hotel, but they
      could not make tea&mdash;now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s one thing I <i>can</i> do,&rdquo; said I, laughing brightly. &ldquo;I can make
      very good tea. The great secret is to warm the teapot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warm the teapot,&rdquo; interrupted the Herr Rat, pushing away his soup plate.
      &ldquo;What do you warm the teapot for? Ha! ha! that&rsquo;s very good! One does not
      eat the teapot, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fixed his cold blue eyes upon me with an expression which suggested a
      thousand premeditated invasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is the great secret of your English tea? All you do is to warm
      the teapot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to say that was only the preliminary canter, but could not
      translate it, and so was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant brought in veal, with &ldquo;sauerkraut&rdquo; and potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I eat sauerkraut with great pleasure,&rdquo; said the Traveller from North
      Germany, &ldquo;but now I have eaten so much of it that I cannot retain it. I am
      immediately forced to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful day,&rdquo; I cried, turning to Fräulein Stiegelauer. &ldquo;Did you get
      up early?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At five o&rsquo;clock I walked for ten minutes in the wet grass. Again in bed.
      At half-past five I fell asleep, and woke at seven, when I made an
      &lsquo;overbody&rsquo; washing! Again in bed. At eight o&rsquo;clock I had a cold-water
      poultice, and at half past eight I drank a cup of mint tea. At nine I
      drank some malt coffee, and began my &lsquo;cure.&rsquo; Pass me the sauerkraut,
      please. You do not eat it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you. I still find it a little strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true,&rdquo; asked the Widow, picking her teeth with a hairpin as she
      spoke, &ldquo;that you are a vegetarian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes; I have not eaten meat for three years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Im&mdash;possible! Have you any family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, you see, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re coming to! Who ever heard of
      having children upon vegetables? It is not possible. But you never have
      large families in England now; I suppose you are too busy with your
      suffragetting. Now I have had nine children, and they are all alive, thank
      God. Fine, healthy babies&mdash;though after the first one was born I had
      to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How <i>wonderful!</i>&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; said the Widow contemptuously, replacing the hairpin in the
      knob which was balanced on the top of her head. &ldquo;Not at all! A friend of
      mine had four at the same time. Her husband was so pleased he gave a
      supper-party and had them placed on the table. Of course she was very
      proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Germany,&rdquo; boomed the Traveller, biting round a potato which he had
      speared with his knife, &ldquo;is the home of the Family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Followed an appreciative silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dishes were changed for beef, red currants and spinach. They wiped
      their forks upon black bread and started again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long are you remaining here?&rdquo; asked the Herr Rat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know exactly. I must be back in London in September.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you will visit München?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I shall not have time. You see, it is important not to break
      into my &lsquo;cure.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you <i>must</i> go to München. You have not seen Germany if you have not
      been to München. All the Exhibitions, all the Art and Soul life of Germany
      are in München. There is the Wagner Festival in August, and Mozart and a
      Japanese collection of pictures&mdash;and there is the beer! You do not
      know what good beer is until you have been to München. Why, I see fine
      ladies every afternoon, but fine ladies, I tell you, drinking glasses so
      high.&rdquo; He measured a good washstand pitcher in height, and I smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I drink a great deal of München beer I sweat so,&rdquo; said Herr Hoffmann.
      &ldquo;When I am here, in the fields or before my baths, I sweat, but I enjoy
      it; but in the town it is not at all the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prompted by the thought, he wiped his neck and face with his dinner napkin
      and carefully cleaned his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      A glass dish of stewed apricots was placed upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, fruit!&rdquo; said Fräulein Stiegelauer, &ldquo;that is so necessary to health.
      The doctor told me this morning that the more fruit I could eat the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She very obviously followed the advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the Traveller: &ldquo;I suppose you are frightened of an invasion, too, eh?
      Oh, that&rsquo;s good. I&rsquo;ve been reading all about your English play in a
      newspaper. Did you see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I sat upright. &ldquo;I assure you we are not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you ought to be,&rdquo; said the Herr Rat. &ldquo;You have got no army at
      all&mdash;a few little boys with their veins full of nicotine poisoning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; Herr Hoffmann said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want England. If we did
      we would have had her long ago. We really do not want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his spoon airily, looking across at me as though I were a little
      child whom he would keep or dismiss as he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We certainly do not want Germany,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning I took a half bath. Then this afternoon I must take a knee
      bath and an arm bath,&rdquo; volunteered the Herr Rat; &ldquo;then I do my exercises
      for an hour, and my work is over. A glass of wine and a couple of rolls
      with some sardines&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were handed cherry cake with whipped cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your husband&rsquo;s favourite meat?&rdquo; asked the Widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really do not know,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really do not know? How long have you been married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you cannot be in earnest! You would not have kept house as his wife
      for a week without knowing that fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really never asked him; he is not at all particular about his food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pause. They all looked at me, shaking their heads, their mouths full of
      cherry stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder there is a repetition in England of that dreadful state of
      things in Paris,&rdquo; said the Widow, folding her dinner napkin. &ldquo;How can a
      woman expect to keep her husband if she does not know his favourite food
      after three years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mahlzeit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mahlzeit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I closed the door after me.

    <h2>
      2. THE BARON
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And why does he sit always alone, with his back to
      us, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; whispered the Frau Oberregierungsrat, &ldquo;he is a <i>Baron</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me very solemnly, and yet with the slightest possible
      contempt&mdash;a &ldquo;fancy-not-recognising-that-at-the-first-glance&rdquo;
       expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, poor soul, he cannot help it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Surely that unfortunate fact
      ought not to debar him from the pleasures of intellectual intercourse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If it had not been for her fork I think she would have crossed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you cannot understand. He is one of the First Barons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More than a little unnerved, she turned and spoke to the Frau Doktor on
      her left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My omelette is empty&mdash;<i>empty</i>,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;and
      this is the third I have tried!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the First of the Barons. He was eating salad&mdash;taking a
      whole lettuce leaf on his fork and absorbing it slowly, rabbit-wise&mdash;a
      fascinating process to watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small and slight, with scanty black hair and beard and yellow-toned
      complexion, he invariably wore black serge clothes, a rough linen shirt,
      black sandals, and the largest black-rimmed spectacles that I had ever
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Herr Oberlehrer, who sat opposite me, smiled benignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be very interesting for you, gnädige Frau, to be able to
      watch... of course this is a <i>very fine house</i>. There was a lady from the
      Spanish Court here in the summer; she had a liver. We often spoke
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked gratified and humble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, in England, in your &lsquo;boarding &rsquo;ouse&rsquo;, one does
      not find the First Class, as in Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; I replied, still hypnotised by the Baron, who looked like a
      little yellow silkworm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baron comes every year,&rdquo; went on the Herr Oberlehrer, &ldquo;for his
      nerves. He has never spoken to any of the guests&mdash;<i>yet</i>.&rdquo; A smile
      crossed his face. I seemed to see his visions of some splendid upheaval of
      that silence&mdash;a dazzling exchange of courtesies in a dim future, a
      splendid sacrifice of a newspaper to this Exalted One, a &ldquo;danke schön&rdquo; to
      be handed down to future generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the postman, looking like a German army officer, came in
      with the mail. He threw my letters into my milk pudding, and then turned
      to a waitress and whispered. She retired hastily. The manager of the
      pension came in with a little tray. A picture post card was deposited on
      it, and reverently bowing his head, the manager of the pension carried it
      to the Baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myself, I felt disappointed that there was not a salute of twenty-five
      guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the meal we were served with coffee. I noticed the Baron
      took three lumps of sugar, putting two in his cup and wrapping up the
      third in a corner of his pocket-handkerchief. He was always the first to
      enter the dining-room and the last to leave; and in a vacant chair beside
      him he placed a little black leather bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, leaning from my window, I saw him pass down the street,
      walking tremulously and carrying the bag. Each time he passed a lamp-post
      he shrank a little, as though expecting it to strike him, or maybe the
      sense of plebeian contamination....
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered where he was going, and why he carried the bag. Never had I
      seen him at the Casino or the Bath Establishment. He looked forlorn, his
      feet slipped in his sandals. I found myself pitying the Baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening a party of us were gathered in the salon discussing the day&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;kur&rdquo; with feverish animation. The Frau Oberregierungsrat sat by me
      knitting a shawl for her youngest of nine daughters, who was in that very
      interesting, frail condition.... &ldquo;But it is bound to be quite
      satisfactory,&rdquo; she said to me. &ldquo;The dear married a banker&mdash;the
      desire of her life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There must have been eight or ten of us gathered together, we who were
      married exchanging confidences as to the underclothing and peculiar
      characteristics of our husbands, the unmarried discussing the
      over-clothing and peculiar fascinations of Possible Ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knit them myself,&rdquo; I heard the Frau Lehrer cry, &ldquo;of thick grey wool. He
      wears one a month, with two soft collars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; whispered Fräulein Lisa, &ldquo;he said to me, &lsquo;Indeed you please
      me. I shall, perhaps, write to your mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Small wonder that we were a little violently excited, a little
      expostulatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the door opened and admitted the Baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed a complete and deathlike silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in slowly, hesitated, took up a toothpick from a dish on the top
      of the piano, and went out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door was closed we raised a triumphant cry! It was the first time
      he had ever been known to enter the salon. Who could tell what the Future
      held?
    </p>
    <p>
      Days lengthened into weeks. Still we were together, and still the solitary
      little figure, head bowed as though under the weight of the spectacles,
      haunted me. He entered with the black bag, he retired with the black bag&mdash;and
      that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the manager of the pension told us the Baron was leaving the next
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;surely he cannot drift into obscurity&mdash;be lost
      without one word! Surely he will honour the Frau Oberregierungsrat or the
      Frau Feldleutnantswitwe <i>once</i> before he goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the evening of that day it rained heavily. I went to the post office,
      and as I stood on the steps, umbrellaless, hesitating before plunging into
      the slushy road, a little, hesitating voice seemed to come from under my
      elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked down. It was the First of the Barons with the black bag and an
      umbrella. Was I mad? Was I sane? He was asking me to share the latter. But
      I was exceedingly nice, a trifle diffident, appropriately reverential.
      Together we walked through the mud and slush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there is something peculiarly intimate in sharing an umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is apt to put one on the same footing as brushing a man&rsquo;s coat for him&mdash;a
      little daring, naïve.
    </p>
    <p>
      I longed to know why he sat alone, why he carried the bag, what he did all
      day. But he himself volunteered some information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that my luggage will be damp. I invariably carry it
      with me in this bag&mdash;one requires so little&mdash;for servants are
      untrustworthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wise idea,&rdquo; I answered. And then: &ldquo;Why have you denied us the pleasure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sit alone that I may eat more,&rdquo; said the Baron, peering into the dusk;
      &ldquo;my stomach requires a great deal of food. I order double portions, and
      eat them in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which sounded finely Baronial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you do all day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imbibe nourishment in my room,&rdquo; he replied, in a voice that closed the
      conversation and almost repented of the umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we arrived at the pension there was very nearly an open riot.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran half way up the stairs, and thanked the Baron audibly from the
      landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He distinctly replied: &ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was very friendly of the Herr Oberlehrer to have sent me a bouquet that
      evening, and the Frau Oberregierungsrat asked me for my pattern of a
      baby&rsquo;s bonnet!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day the Baron was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sic transit gloria German mundi.

    <h2>
      3. THE SISTER OF THE BARONESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two new guests arriving this afternoon,&rdquo; said the manager of
      the pension, placing a chair for me at the breakfast-table. &ldquo;I have only
      received the letter acquainting me with the fact this morning. The
      Baroness von Gall is sending her little daughter&mdash;the poor child is
      dumb&mdash;to make the &lsquo;cure.&rsquo; She is to stay with us a month, and then
      the Baroness herself is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baroness von Gall,&rdquo; cried the Frau Doktor, coming into the room and
      positively scenting the name. &ldquo;Coming here? There was a picture of her
      only last week in <i>Sport and Salon</i>. She is a friend of the Court: I have
      heard that the Kaiserin says &lsquo;du&rsquo; to her. But this is delightful! I shall
      take my doctor&rsquo;s advice and spend an extra six weeks here. There is
      nothing like young society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the child is dumb,&rdquo; ventured the manager apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! What does that matter? Afflicted children have such pretty ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Each guest who came into the breakfast-room was bombarded with the
      wonderful news. &ldquo;The Baroness von Gall is sending her little daughter
      here; the Baroness herself is coming in a month&rsquo;s time.&rdquo; Coffee and rolls
      took on the nature of an orgy. We positively scintillated. Anecdotes of
      the High Born were poured out, sweetened and sipped: we gorged on scandals
      of High Birth generously buttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are to have the room next to yours,&rdquo; said the manager, addressing
      me. &ldquo;I was wondering if you would permit me to take down the portrait of
      the Kaiserin Elizabeth from above your bed to hang over their sofa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, something homelike&rdquo;&mdash;the Frau Oberregierungsrat patted
      my hand&mdash;&ldquo;and of no possible significance to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt a little crushed. Not at the prospect of losing that vision of
      diamonds and blue velvet bust, but at the tone&mdash;placing me outside
      the pale&mdash;branding me as a foreigner.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dissipated the day in valid speculations. Decided it was too warm to
      walk in the afternoon, so lay down on our beds, mustering in great force
      for afternoon coffee. And a carriage drew up at the door. A tall young
      girl got out, leading a child by the hand. They entered the hall, were
      greeted and shown to their room. Ten minutes later she came down with the
      child to sign the visitors&rsquo; book. She wore a black, closely fitting dress,
      touched at throat and wrists with white frilling. Her brown hair, braided,
      was tied with a black bow&mdash;unusually pale, with a small mole on her
      left cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the Baroness von Gall&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; she said, trying the pen on a piece
      of blotting-paper, and smiling at us deprecatingly. Even for the most
      jaded of us life holds its thrilling moments. Two Baronesses in two
      months! The manager immediately left the room to find a new nib.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my plebeian eyes that afflicted child was singularly unattractive. She
      had the air of having been perpetually washed with a blue bag, and hair
      like grey wool&mdash;dressed, too, in a pinafore so stiffly starched that
      she could only peer at us over the frill of it&mdash;a social barrier of a
      pinafore&mdash;and perhaps it was too much to expect a noble aunt to
      attend to the menial consideration of her niece&rsquo;s ears. But a dumb niece
      with unwashed ears struck me as a most depressing object.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were given places at the head of the table. For a moment we all
      looked at one another with an eena-deena-dina-do expression. Then the Frau
      Oberregierungsrat:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are not tired after your journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the sister of the Baroness, smiling into her cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the dear child is not tired,&rdquo; said the Frau Doktor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect, I hope you will sleep well to-night,&rdquo; the Herr Oberlehrer said
      reverently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poet from Munich never took his eyes off the pair. He allowed his tie
      to absorb most of his coffee while he gazed at them exceedingly soulfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unyoking Pegasus, thought I. Death spasms of his Odes to Solitude! There
      were possibilities in that young woman for an inspiration, not to mention
      a dedication, and from that moment his suffering temperament took up its
      bed and walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      They retired after the meal, leaving us to discuss them at leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a likeness,&rdquo; mused the Frau Doktor. &ldquo;Quite. What a manner she
      has. Such reserve, such a tender way with the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity she has the child to attend to,&rdquo; exclaimed the student from Bonn. He
      had hitherto relied upon three scars and a ribbon to produce an effect,
      but the sister of a Baroness demanded more than these.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbing days followed. Had she been one whit less beautifully born we
      could not have endured the continual conversation about her, the songs in
      her praise, the detailed account of her movements. But she graciously
      suffered our worship and we were more than content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poet she took into her confidence. He carried her books when we went
      walking, he jumped the afflicted one on his knee&mdash;poetic licence,
      this&mdash;and one morning brought his notebook into the salon and read to
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sister of the Baroness has assured me she is going into a convent,&rdquo;
       he said. (That made the student from Bonn sit up.) &ldquo;I have written these
      few lines last night from my window in the sweet night air&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your <i>delicate</i> chest,&rdquo; commented the Frau Doktor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fixed a stony eye on her, and she blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have written these lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, will you to a convent fly,
   So young, so fresh, so fair?
  Spring like a doe upon the fields
   And find your beauty there.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Nine verses equally lovely commanded her to equally violent action. I am
      certain that had she followed his advice not even the remainder of her
      life in a convent would have given her time to recover her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have presented her with a copy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And to-day we are going to
      look for wild flowers in the wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The student from Bonn got up and left the room. I begged the poet to
      repeat the verses once more. At the end of the sixth verse I saw from the
      window the sister of the Baroness and the scarred youth disappearing
      through the front gate, which enabled me to thank the poet so charmingly
      that he offered to write me out a copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we were living at too high pressure in those days. Swinging from our
      humble pension to the high walls of palaces, how could we help but fall?
      Late one afternoon the Frau Doktor came upon me in the writing-room and
      took me to her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been telling me all about her life,&rdquo; whispered the Frau Doktor.
      &ldquo;She came to my bedroom and offered to massage my arm. You know, I am the
      greatest martyr to rheumatism. And, fancy now, she has already had six
      proposals of marriage. Such beautiful offers that I assure you I wept&mdash;and
      every one of noble birth. My dear, the most beautiful was in the wood. Not
      that I do not think a proposal should take place in a drawing-room&mdash;it
      is more fitting to have four walls&mdash;but this was a private wood. He
      said, the young officer, she was like a young tree whose branches had
      never been touched by the ruthless hand of man. Such delicacy!&rdquo; She sighed
      and turned up her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is difficult for you English to understand when you are
      always exposing your legs on cricket-fields, and breeding dogs in your
      back gardens. The pity of it! Youth should be like a wild rose. For myself
      I do not understand how your women ever get married at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head so violently that I shook mine too, and a gloom settled
      round my heart. It seemed we were really in a very bad way. Did the spirit
      of romance spread her rose wings only over aristocratic Germany?
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to my room, bound a pink scarf about my hair, and took a volume of
      Mörike&rsquo;s lyrics into the garden. A great bush of purple lilac grew behind
      the summer-house. There I sat down, finding a sad significance in the
      delicate suggestion of half mourning. I began to write a poem myself.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;They sway and languish dreamily,
   And we, close pressed, are kissing there.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It ended! &ldquo;Close pressed&rdquo; did not sound at all fascinating. Savoured of
      wardrobes. Did my wild rose then already trail in the dust? I chewed a
      leaf and hugged my knees. Then&mdash;magic moment&mdash;I heard voices
      from the summer-house, the sister of the Baroness and the student from
      Bonn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second-hand was better than nothing; I pricked up my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What small hands you have,&rdquo; said the student from Bonn. &ldquo;They are like
      white lilies lying in the pool of your black dress.&rdquo; This certainly
      sounded the real thing. Her high-born reply was what interested me.
      Sympathetic murmur only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I hold one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard two sighs&mdash;presumed they held&mdash;he had rifled those dark
      waters of a noble blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at my great fingers beside yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are beautifully kept,&rdquo; said the sister of the Baroness shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minx! Was love then a question of manicure?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I should adore to kiss you,&rdquo; murmured the student. &ldquo;But you know I am
      suffering from severe nasal catarrh, and I dare not risk giving it to you.
      Sixteen times last night did I count myself sneezing. And three different
      handkerchiefs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I threw Mörike into the lilac bush, and went back to the house. A great
      automobile snorted at the front door. In the salon great commotion. The
      Baroness was paying a surprise visit to her little daughter. Clad in a
      yellow mackintosh she stood in the middle of the room questioning the
      manager. And every guest the pension contained was grouped about her, even
      the Frau Doktor, presumably examining a timetable, as near to the august
      skirts as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where is my maid?&rdquo; asked the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no maid,&rdquo; replied the manager, &ldquo;save for your gracious sister
      and daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister!&rdquo; she cried sharply. &ldquo;Fool, I have no sister. My child travelled
      with the daughter of my dressmaker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tableau grandissimo!

    <h2>
      4. FRAU FISCHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Frau Fischer was the fortunate possessor of a candle factory somewhere on
      the banks of the Eger, and once a year she ceased from her labours to make
      a &ldquo;cure&rdquo; in Dorschausen, arriving with a dress-basket neatly covered in a
      black tarpaulin and a hand-bag. The latter contained amongst her
      handkerchiefs, eau de Cologne, toothpicks, and a certain woollen muffler
      very comforting to the &ldquo;magen,&rdquo; samples of her skill in candle-making, to
      be offered up as tokens of thanksgiving when her holiday time was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four of the clock one July afternoon she appeared at the Pension Müller. I
      was sitting in the arbour and watched her bustling up the path followed by
      the red-bearded porter with her dress-basket in his arms and a sunflower
      between his teeth. The widow and her five innocent daughters stood
      tastefully grouped upon the steps in appropriate attitudes of welcome; and
      the greetings were so long and loud that I felt a sympathetic glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a journey!&rdquo; cried the Frau Fischer. &ldquo;And nothing to eat in the train&mdash;nothing
      solid. I assure you the sides of my stomach are flapping together. But I
      must not spoil my appetite for dinner&mdash;just a cup of coffee in my
      room. Bertha,&rdquo; turning to the youngest of the five, &ldquo;how changed! What a
      bust! Frau Hartmann, I congratulate you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once again the Widow seized Frau Fischer&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Kathi, too, a splendid
      woman; but a little pale. Perhaps the young man from Nürnberg is here
      again this year. How you keep them all I don&rsquo;t know. Each year I come
      expecting to find you with an empty nest. It&rsquo;s surprising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frau Hartmann, in an ashamed, apologetic voice: &ldquo;We are such a happy
      family since my dear man died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these marriages&mdash;one must have courage; and after all, give them
      time, they all make the happy family bigger&mdash;thank God for that....
      Are there many people here just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every room engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Followed a detailed description in the hall, murmured on the stairs,
      continued in six parts as they entered the large room (windows opening
      upon the garden) which Frau Fischer occupied each successive year. I was
      reading the &ldquo;Miracles of Lourdes,&rdquo; which a Catholic priest&mdash;fixing a
      gloomy eye upon my soul&mdash;had begged me to digest; but its wonders
      were completely routed by Frau Fischer&rsquo;s arrival. Not even the white roses
      upon the feet of the Virgin could flourish in that atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... It was a simple shepherd-child who pastured her flocks upon the
      barren fields....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Voices from the room above: &ldquo;The washstand has, of course, been scrubbed
      over with soda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... Poverty-stricken, her limbs with tattered rags half covered...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every stick of the furniture has been sunning in the garden for three
      days. And the carpet we made ourselves out of old clothes. There is a
      piece of that beautiful flannel petticoat you left us last summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... Deaf and dumb was the child; in fact, the population considered her
      half idiot...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is a new picture of the Kaiser. We have moved the thorn-crowned
      one of Jesus Christ out into the passage. It was not cheerful to sleep
      with. Dear Frau Fischer, won&rsquo;t you take your coffee out in the garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very nice idea. But first I must remove my corsets and my
      boots. Ah, what a relief to wear sandals again. I am needing the &lsquo;cure&rsquo;
      very badly this year. My nerves! I am a mass of them. During the entire
      journey I sat with my handkerchief over my head, even while the guard
      collected the tickets. Exhausted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came into the arbour wearing a black and white spotted dressing-gown,
      and a calico cap peaked with patent leather, followed by Kathi, carrying
      the little blue jugs of malt coffee. We were formally introduced. Frau
      Fischer sat down, produced a perfectly clean pocket handkerchief and
      polished her cup and saucer, then lifted the lid of the coffee-pot and
      peered in at the contents mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Malt coffee,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ah, for the first few days I wonder how I can
      put up with it. Naturally, absent from home one must expect much
      discomfort and strange food. But as I used to say to my dear husband: with
      a clean sheet and a good cup of coffee I can find my happiness anywhere.
      But now, with nerves like mine, no sacrifice is too terrible for me to
      make. What complaint are you suffering from? You look exceedingly
      healthy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled and shrugged my shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is so strange about you English. You do not seem to enjoy
      discussing the functions of the body. As well speak of a railway train and
      refuse to mention the engine. How can we hope to understand anybody,
      knowing nothing of their stomachs? In my husband&rsquo;s most severe illness&mdash;the
      poultices&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dipped a piece of sugar in her coffee and watched it dissolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet a young friend of mine who travelled to England for the funeral of
      his brother told me that women wore bodices in public restaurants no
      waiter could help looking into as he handed the soup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But only German waiters,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;English ones look over the top of your
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;now you see your dependence on Germany. Not even an
      efficient waiter can you have by yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I prefer them to look over your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that proves that you must be ashamed of your bodice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked out over the garden full of wall-flowers and standard rose-trees
      growing stiffly like German bouquets, feeling I did not care one way or
      the other. I rather wanted to ask her if the young friend had gone to
      England in the capacity of waiter to attend the funeral baked meats, but
      decided it was not worth it. The weather was too hot to be malicious, and
      who could be uncharitable, victimised by the flapping sensations which
      Frau Fischer was enduring until six-thirty? As a gift from heaven for my
      forbearance, down the path towards us came the Herr Rat, angelically clad
      in a white silk suit. He and Frau Fischer were old friends. She drew the
      folds of her dressing-gown together, and made room for him on the little
      green bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How cool you are looking,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and if I may make the remark&mdash;what
      a beautiful suit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely I wore it last summer when you were here? I brought the silk from
      China&mdash;smuggled it through the Russian customs by swathing it round
      my body. And such a quantity: two dress lengths for my sister-in-law,
      three suits for myself, a cloak for the housekeeper of my flat in Munich.
      How I perspired! Every inch of it had to be washed afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you have had more adventures than any man in Germany. When I think
      of the time that you spent in Turkey with a drunken guide who was bitten
      by a mad dog and fell over a precipice into a field of attar of roses, I
      lament that you have not written a book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time&mdash;time. I am getting a few notes together. And now that you are
      here we shall renew our quiet little talks after supper. Yes? It is
      necessary and pleasant for a man to find relaxation in the company of
      women occasionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I realise that. Even here your life is too strenuous&mdash;you are
      so sought after&mdash;so admired. It was just the same with my dear
      husband. He was a tall, beautiful man, and sometimes in the evening he
      would come down into the kitchen and say: &lsquo;Wife, I would like to be stupid
      for two minutes.&rsquo; Nothing rested him so much then as for me to stroke his
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Herr Rat&rsquo;s bald pate glistening in the sunlight seemed symbolical of
      the sad absence of a wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to wonder as to the nature of these quiet little after-supper
      talks. How could one play Delilah to so shorn a Samson?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herr Hoffmann from Berlin arrived yesterday,&rdquo; said the Herr Rat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young man I refuse to converse with. He told me last year that he
      had stayed in France in an hotel where they did not have serviettes; what
      a place it must have been! In Austria even the cabmen have serviettes.
      Also I have heard that he discussed &lsquo;free love&rsquo; with Bertha as she was
      sweeping his room. I am not accustomed to such company. I had suspected
      him for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young blood,&rdquo; answered the Herr Rat genially. &ldquo;I have had several
      disputes with him&mdash;you have heard them&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo; turning
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great many,&rdquo; I said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless you too consider me behind the times. I make no secret of my
      age; I am sixty-nine; but you must have surely observed how impossible it
      was for him to speak at all when I raised my voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied with the utmost conviction, and, catching Frau Fischer&rsquo;s eye,
      suddenly realised I had better go back to the house and write some
      letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark and cool in my room. A chestnut-tree pushed green boughs
      against the window. I looked down at the horsehair sofa so openly flouting
      the idea of curling up as immoral, pulled the red pillow on to the floor
      and lay down. And barely had I got comfortable when the door opened and
      Frau Fischer entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Herr Rat had a bathing appointment,&rdquo; she said, shutting the door
      after her. &ldquo;May I come in? Pray do not move. You look like a little
      Persian kitten. Now, tell me something really interesting about your life.
      When I meet new people I squeeze them dry like a sponge. To begin with&mdash;you
      are married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I admit the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, dear child, where is your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said he was a sea-captain on a long and perilous voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a position to leave you in&mdash;so young and so unprotected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on the sofa and shook her finger at me playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admit, now, that you keep your journeys secret from him. For what man
      would think of allowing a woman with such a wealth of hair to go wandering
      in foreign countries? Now, supposing that you lost your purse at midnight
      in a snowbound train in North Russia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t the slightest intention&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that you have. But when you said good-bye to your dear man I
      am positive that you had no intention of coming here. My dear, I am a
      woman of experience, and I know the world. While he is away you have a
      fever in your blood. Your sad heart flies for comfort to these foreign
      lands. At home you cannot bear the sight of that empty bed&mdash;it is
      like widowhood. Since the death of my dear husband I have never known an
      hour&rsquo;s peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like empty beds,&rdquo; I protested sleepily, thumping the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That cannot be true because it is not natural. Every wife ought to feel
      that her place is by her husband&rsquo;s side&mdash;sleeping or waking. It is
      plain to see that the strongest tie of all does not yet bind you. Wait
      until a little pair of hands stretches across the water&mdash;wait until
      he comes into harbour and sees you with the child at your breast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat up stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I consider child-bearing the most ignominious of all professions,&rdquo; I
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was silence. Then Frau Fischer reached down and caught
      my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So young and yet to suffer so cruelly,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;There is nothing
      that sours a woman so terribly as to be left alone without a man,
      especially if she is married, for then it is impossible for her to accept
      the attention of others&mdash;unless she is unfortunately a widow. Of
      course, I know that sea-captains are subject to terrible temptations, and
      they are as inflammable as tenor singers&mdash;that is why you must
      present a bright and energetic appearance, and try and make him proud of
      you when his ship reaches port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This husband that I had created for the benefit of Frau Fischer became in
      her hands so substantial a figure that I could no longer see myself
      sitting on a rock with seaweed in my hair, awaiting that phantom ship for
      which all women love to suppose they hunger. Rather, I saw myself pushing a
      perambulator up the gangway, and counting up the missing buttons on my
      husband&rsquo;s uniform jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handfuls of babies, that is what you are really in need of,&rdquo; mused Frau
      Fischer. &ldquo;Then, as the father of a family he cannot leave you. Think of
      his delight and excitement when he saw you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The plan seemed to me something of a risk. To appear suddenly with
      handfuls of strange babies is not generally calculated to raise enthusiasm
      in the heart of the average British husband. I decided to wreck my virgin
      conception and send him down somewhere off Cape Horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the dinner-gong sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up to my room afterwards,&rdquo; said Frau Fischer. &ldquo;There is still much
      that I must ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She squeezed my hand, but I did not squeeze back.

      5. FRAU BRECHENMACHER ATTENDS A WEDDING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Getting ready was a terrible business. After supper Frau Brechenmacher
      packed four of the five babies to bed, allowing Rosa to stay with her and
      help to polish the buttons of Herr Brechenmacher&rsquo;s uniform. Then she ran
      over his best shirt with a hot iron, polished his boots, and put a stitch
      or two into his black satin necktie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosa,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;fetch my dress and hang it in front of the stove to get
      the creases out. Now, mind, you must look after the children and not sit
      up later than half-past eight, and not touch the lamp&mdash;you know what
      will happen if you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mamma,&rdquo; said Rosa, who was nine and felt old enough to manage a
      thousand lamps. &ldquo;But let me stay up&mdash;the &lsquo;Bub&rsquo; may wake and want some
      milk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-past eight!&rdquo; said the Frau. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the father tell you too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosa drew down the corners of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But... but...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes the father. You go into the bedroom and fetch my blue silk
      handkerchief. You can wear my black shawl while I&rsquo;m out&mdash;there now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosa dragged it off her mother&rsquo;s shoulders and wound it carefully round
      her own, tying the two ends in a knot at the back. After all, she
      reflected, if she had to go to bed at half past eight she would keep the
      shawl on. Which resolution comforted her absolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, where are my clothes?&rdquo; cried Herr Brechenmacher, hanging his
      empty letter-bag behind the door and stamping the snow out of his boots.
      &ldquo;Nothing ready, of course, and everybody at the wedding by this time. I
      heard the music as I passed. What are you doing? You&rsquo;re not dressed. You
      can&rsquo;t go like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they are&mdash;all ready for you on the table, and some warm water
      in the tin basin. Dip your head in. Rosa, give your father the towel.
      Everything ready except the trousers. I haven&rsquo;t had time to shorten them.
      You must tuck the ends into your boots until we get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nu,&rdquo; said the Herr, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t room to turn. I want the light. You go
      and dress in the passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dressing in the dark was nothing to Frau Brechenmacher. She hooked her
      skirt and bodice, fastened her handkerchief round her neck with a
      beautiful brooch that had four medals to the Virgin dangling from it, and
      then drew on her cloak and hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, come and fasten this buckle,&rdquo; called Herr Brechenmacher. He stood
      in the kitchen puffing himself out, the buttons on his blue uniform
      shining with an enthusiasm which nothing but official buttons could
      possibly possess. &ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; replied the little Frau, straining at the waist buckle and
      giving him a little pull here, a little tug there. &ldquo;Rosa, come and look at
      your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herr Brechenmacher strode up and down the kitchen, was helped on with his
      coat, then waited while the Frau lighted the lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then&mdash;finished at last! Come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lamp, Rosa,&rdquo; warned the Frau, slamming the front door behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snow had not fallen all day; the frozen ground was slippery as an icepond.
      She had not been out of the house for weeks past, and the day had so
      flurried her that she felt muddled and stupid&mdash;felt that Rosa had
      pushed her out of the house and her man was running away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, wait!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll get my feet damp&mdash;you hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was easier when they came into the village. There were fences to cling
      to, and leading from the railway station to the Gasthaus a little path of
      cinders had been strewn for the benefit of the wedding guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gasthaus was very festive. Lights shone out from every window, wreaths
      of fir twigs hung from the ledges. Branches decorated the front doors,
      which swung open, and in the hall the landlord voiced his superiority by
      bullying the waitresses, who ran about continually with glasses of beer,
      trays of cups and saucers, and bottles of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up the stairs&mdash;up the stairs!&rdquo; boomed the landlord. &ldquo;Leave your
      coats on the landing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herr Brechenmacher, completely overawed by this grand manner, so far
      forgot his rights as a husband as to beg his wife&rsquo;s pardon for jostling
      her against the banisters in his efforts to get ahead of everybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Brechenmacher&rsquo;s colleagues greeted him with acclamation as he entered
      the door of the Festsaal, and the Frau straightened her brooch and folded
      her hands, assuming the air of dignity becoming to the wife of a postman
      and the mother of five children. Beautiful indeed was the Festsaal. Three
      long tables were grouped at one end, the remainder of the floor space
      cleared for dancing. Oil lamps, hanging from the ceiling, shed a warm,
      bright light on the walls decorated with paper flowers and garlands; shed
      a warmer, brighter light on the red faces of the guests in their best
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the centre table sat the bride and bridegroom, she in a
      white dress trimmed with stripes and bows of coloured ribbon, giving her
      the appearance of an iced cake all ready to be cut and served in neat
      little pieces to the bridegroom beside her, who wore a suit of white
      clothes much too large for him and a white silk tie that rose halfway up
      his collar. Grouped about them, with a fine regard for dignity and
      precedence, sat their parents and relations; and perched on a stool at the
      bride&rsquo;s right hand a little girl in a crumpled muslin dress with a wreath
      of forget-me-nots hanging over one ear. Everybody was laughing and
      talking, shaking hands, clinking glasses, stamping on the floor&mdash;a
      stench of beer and perspiration filled the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frau Brechenmacher, following her man down the room after greeting the
      bridal party, knew that she was going to enjoy herself. She seemed to fill
      out and become rosy and warm as she sniffed that familiar festive smell.
      Somebody pulled at her skirt, and, looking down, she saw Frau Rupp, the
      butcher&rsquo;s wife, who pulled out an empty chair and begged her to sit beside
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fritz will get you some beer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My dear, your skirt is open at
      the back. We could not help laughing as you walked up the room with the
      white tape of your petticoat showing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how frightful!&rdquo; said Frau Brechenmacher, collapsing into her chair
      and biting her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, it&rsquo;s over now,&rdquo; said Frau Rupp, stretching her fat hands over the
      table and regarding her three mourning rings with intense enjoyment; &ldquo;but
      one must be careful, especially at a wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such a wedding as this,&rdquo; cried Frau Ledermann, who sat on the other
      side of Frau Brechenmacher. &ldquo;Fancy Theresa bringing that child with her.
      It&rsquo;s her own child, you know, my dear, and it&rsquo;s going to live with them.
      That&rsquo;s what I call a sin against the Church for a free-born child to
      attend its own mother&rsquo;s wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three women sat and stared at the bride, who remained very still, with
      a little vacant smile on her lips, only her eyes shifting uneasily from
      side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beer they&rsquo;ve given it, too,&rdquo; whispered Frau Rupp, &ldquo;and white wine and an
      ice. It never did have a stomach; she ought to have left it at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frau Brechenmacher turned round and looked towards the bride&rsquo;s mother. She
      never took her eyes off her daughter, but wrinkled her brown forehead like
      an old monkey, and nodded now and again very solemnly. Her hands shook as
      she raised her beer mug, and when she had drunk she spat on the floor and
      savagely wiped her mouth with her sleeve. Then the music started and she
      followed Theresa with her eyes, looking suspiciously at each man who
      danced with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, old woman,&rdquo; shouted her husband, digging her in the ribs; &ldquo;this
      isn&rsquo;t Theresa&rsquo;s funeral.&rdquo; He winked at the guests, who broke into loud
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i> cheerful,&rdquo; mumbled the old woman, and beat upon
      the table with her fist, keeping time to the music, proving she was not
      out of the festivities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t forget how wild Theresa has been,&rdquo; said Frau Ledermann. &ldquo;Who
      could&mdash;with the child there? I heard that last Sunday evening Theresa
      had hysterics and said that she would not marry this man. They had to get
      the priest to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the other one?&rdquo; asked Frau Brechenmacher. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he marry
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone&mdash;disappeared. He was a traveller, and only stayed at their
      house two nights. He was selling shirt buttons&mdash;I bought some myself,
      and they were beautiful shirt buttons&mdash;but what a pig of a fellow! I
      can&rsquo;t think what he saw in such a plain girl&mdash;but you never know. Her
      mother says she&rsquo;s been like fire ever since she was sixteen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frau Brechenmacher looked down at her beer and blew a little hole in the
      froth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how a wedding should be,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not religion to love
      two men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice time she&rsquo;ll have with this one,&rdquo; Frau Rupp exclaimed. &ldquo;He was
      lodging with me last summer and I had to get rid of him. He never changed
      his clothes once in two months, and when I spoke to him of the smell in
      his room he told me he was sure it floated up from the shop. Ah, every
      wife has her cross. Isn&rsquo;t that true, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frau Brechenmacher saw her husband among his colleagues at the next table.
      He was drinking far too much, she knew&mdash;gesticulating wildly, the
      saliva spluttering out of his mouth as he talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she assented, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s true. Girls have a lot to learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wedged in between these two fat old women, the Frau had no hope of being
      asked to dance. She watched the couples going round and round; she forgot
      her five babies and her man and felt almost like a girl again. The music
      sounded sad and sweet. Her roughened hands clasped and unclasped
      themselves in the folds of her skirt. While the music went on she was
      afraid to look anybody in the face, and she smiled with a little nervous
      tremor round the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my God,&rdquo; Frau Rupp cried, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve given that child of Theresa&rsquo;s a
      piece of sausage. It&rsquo;s to keep her quiet. There&rsquo;s going to be a
      presentation now&mdash;your man has to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frau Brechenmacher sat up stiffly. The music ceased, and the dancers took
      their places again at the tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Brechenmacher alone remained standing&mdash;he held in his hands a
      big silver coffee-pot. Everybody laughed at his speech, except the Frau;
      everybody roared at his grimaces, and at the way he carried the coffee-pot
      to the bridal pair, as if it were a baby he was holding.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted the lid, peeped in, then shut it down with a little scream and
      sat biting her lips. The bridegroom wrenched the pot away from her and
      drew forth a baby&rsquo;s bottle and two little cradles holding china dolls. As
      he dandled these treasures before Theresa the hot room seemed to heave and
      sway with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frau Brechenmacher did not think it funny. She stared round at the
      laughing faces, and suddenly they all seemed strange to her. She wanted to
      go home and never come out again. She imagined that all these people were
      laughing at her, more people than there were in the room even&mdash;all
      laughing at her because they were so much stronger than she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
     </p>
     <p>
      They walked home in silence. Herr Brechenmacher strode ahead, she
      stumbled after him. White and forsaken lay the road from the railway
      station to their house&mdash;a cold rush of wind blew her hood from her
      face, and suddenly she remembered how they had come home together the
      first night. Now they had five babies and twice as much money; <i>but</i>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, what is it all for?&rdquo; she muttered, and not until she had reached
      home, and prepared a little supper of meat and bread for her man did she
      stop asking herself that silly question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Brechenmacher broke the bread into his plate, smeared it round with
      his fork and chewed greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good?&rdquo; she asked, leaning her arms on the table and pillowing her breast
      against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a piece of the crumb, wiped it round his plate edge, and held it
      up to her mouth. She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not hungry,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is one of the best pieces, and full of the fat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He cleared the plate; then pulled off his boots and flung them into a
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much of a wedding,&rdquo; he said, stretching out his feet and wriggling
      his toes in the worsted socks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;no,&rdquo; she replied, taking up the discarded boots and placing them
      on the oven to dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Brechenmacher yawned and stretched himself, and then looked up at
      her, grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember the night that we came home? You were an innocent one, you
      were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get along! Such a time ago I forget.&rdquo; Well she remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a clout on the ear as you gave me.... But I soon taught you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t start talking. You&rsquo;ve too much beer. Come to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tilted back in his chair, chuckling with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what you said to me that night. God, the trouble you gave me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the little Frau seized the candle and went into the next room. The
      children were all soundly sleeping. She stripped the mattress off the
      baby&rsquo;s bed to see if he was still dry, then began unfastening her blouse
      and skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always the same,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;all over the world the same;
      but, God in heaven&mdash;but <i>stupid</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then even the memory of the wedding faded quite. She lay down on the bed
      and put her arm across her face like a child who expected to be hurt as
      Herr Brechenmacher lurched in.

      6. THE MODERN SOUL
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; said the Herr Professor, squeezing my hand; &ldquo;wonderful
      weather! I have just returned from a party in the wood. I have been making
      music for them on my trombone. You know, these pine-trees provide most
      suitable accompaniment for a trombone! They are sighing delicacy against
      sustained strength, as I remarked once in a lecture on wind instruments in
      Frankfort. May I be permitted to sit beside you on this bench, gnädige
      Frau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, tugging at a white-paper package in the tail pocket of his
      coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cherries,&rdquo; he said, nodding and smiling. &ldquo;There is nothing
      like cherries for producing free saliva after trombone playing, especially after
      Grieg&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ich Liebe Dich.&rsquo; Those sustained blasts
      on &lsquo;liebe&rsquo; make my throat as dry as a railway tunnel. Have
      some?&rdquo; He shook the bag at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer watching you eat them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; He crossed his legs, sticking the cherry bag between his knees,
      to leave both hands free. &ldquo;Psychologically I understood your refusal. It
      is your innate feminine delicacy in preferring etherealised sensations....
      Or perhaps you do not care to eat the worms. All cherries contain worms.
      Once I made a very interesting experiment with a colleague of mine at the
      university. We bit into four pounds of the best cherries and did not find
      one specimen without a worm. But what would you? As I remarked to him
      afterwards&mdash;dear friend, it amounts to this: if one wishes to satisfy
      the desires of nature one must be strong enough to ignore the facts of
      nature.... The conversation is not out of your depth? I have so seldom the
      time or opportunity to open my heart to a woman that I am apt to forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what a fat one!&rdquo; cried the Herr Professor. &ldquo;That is almost a mouthful
      in itself; it is beautiful enough to hang from a watch-chain.&rdquo; He chewed
      it up and spat the stone an incredible distance&mdash;over the garden path
      into the flower bed. He was proud of the feat. I saw it. &ldquo;The quantity of
      fruit I have eaten on this bench,&rdquo; he sighed; &ldquo;apricots, peaches and
      cherries. One day that garden bed will become an orchard grove, and I
      shall allow you to pick as much as you please, without paying me
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was grateful, without showing undue excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which reminds me&rdquo;&mdash;he hit the side of his nose with one finger&mdash;&ldquo;the
      manager of the pension handed me my weekly bill after dinner this evening.
      It is almost impossible to credit. I do not expect you to believe me&mdash;he
      has charged me extra for a miserable little glass of milk I drink in bed
      at night to prevent insomnia. Naturally, I did not pay. But the tragedy of
      the story is this: I cannot expect the milk to produce somnolence any
      longer; my peaceful attitude of mind towards it is completely destroyed. I
      know I shall throw myself into a fever in attempting to plumb this want of
      generosity in so wealthy a man as the manager of a pension. Think of me
      to-night.&rdquo;&mdash;he ground the empty bag under his heel&mdash;&ldquo;think that
      the worst is happening to me as your head drops asleep on your pillow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two ladies came on the front steps of the pension and stood, arm in arm,
      looking over the garden. The one, old and scraggy, dressed almost entirely
      in black bead trimming and a satin reticule; the other, young and thin, in
      a white gown, her yellow hair tastefully garnished with mauve sweet peas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor drew in his feet and sat up sharply, pulling down his
      waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Godowskas,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Do you know them? A mother and daughter
      from Vienna. The mother has an internal complaint and the daughter is an
      actress. Fräulein Sonia is a very modern soul. I think you would find her
      most sympathetic. She is forced to be in attendance on her mother just
      now. But what a temperament! I have once described her in her autograph
      album as a tigress with a flower in the hair. Will you excuse me? Perhaps
      I can persuade them to be introduced to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, &ldquo;I am going up to my room.&rdquo; But the Professor rose and shook a
      playful finger at me. &ldquo;Na,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are friends, and, therefore, I
      shall speak quite frankly to you. I think they would consider it a little
      &lsquo;marked&rsquo; if you immediately retired to the house at their approach, after
      sitting here alone with me in the twilight. You know this world. Yes, you
      know it as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shrugged my shoulders, remarking with one eye that while the Professor
      had been talking the Godowskas had trailed across the lawn towards us.
      They confronted the Herr Professor as he stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; quavered Frau Godowska. &ldquo;Wonderful weather! It has given
      me quite a touch of hay fever!&rdquo; Fräulein Godowska said nothing. She
      swooped over a rose growing in the embryo orchard, then stretched out her
      hand with a magnificent gesture to the Herr Professor. He presented me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my little English friend of whom I have spoken. She is the
      stranger in our midst. We have been eating cherries together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful,&rdquo; sighed Frau Godowska. &ldquo;My daughter and I have often
      observed you through the bedroom window. Haven&rsquo;t we, Sonia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sonia absorbed my outward and visible form with an inward and spiritual
      glance, then repeated the magnificent gesture for my benefit. The four of
      us sat on the bench, with that faint air of excitement of passengers
      established in a railway carriage on the qui vive for the train whistle.
      Frau Godowska sneezed. &ldquo;I wonder if it is hay fever,&rdquo; she remarked,
      worrying the satin reticule for her handkerchief, &ldquo;or would it be the dew.
      Sonia, dear, is the dew falling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fräulein Sonia raised her face to the sky, and half closed her eyes. &ldquo;No,
      mamma, my face is quite warm. Oh, look, Herr Professor, there are swallows
      in flight; they are like a little flock of Japanese thoughts&mdash;nicht
      wahr?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; cried the Herr Professor. &ldquo;Oh yes, I see, by the kitchen chimney.
      But why do you say &lsquo;Japanese&rsquo;? Could you not compare them with equal
      veracity to a little flock of German thoughts in flight?&rdquo; He rounded on
      me. &ldquo;Have you swallows in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe there are some at certain seasons. But doubtless they have not
      the same symbolical value for the English. In Germany&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been to England,&rdquo; interrupted Fräulein Sonia, &ldquo;but I have
      many English acquaintances. They are so cold!&rdquo; She shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fish-blooded,&rdquo; snapped Frau Godowska. &ldquo;Without soul, without heart,
      without grace. But you cannot equal their dress materials. I spent a week
      in Brighton twenty years ago, and the travelling cape I bought there is
      not yet worn out&mdash;the one you wrap the hot-water bottle in, Sonia. My
      lamented husband, your father, Sonia, knew a great deal about England. But
      the more he knew about it the oftener he remarked to me, &lsquo;England is
      merely an island of beef flesh swimming in a warm gulf sea of gravy.&rsquo; Such
      a brilliant way of putting things. Do you remember, Sonia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget nothing, mamma,&rdquo; answered Sonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the Herr Professor: &ldquo;That is the proof of your calling, gnädiges
      Fräulein. Now I wonder&mdash;and this is a very interesting speculation&mdash;is
      memory a blessing or&mdash;excuse the word&mdash;a curse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frau Godowska looked into the distance, then the corners of her mouth
      dropped and her skin puckered. She began to shed tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach Gott! Gracious lady, what have I said?&rdquo; exclaimed the Herr Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sonia took her mother&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to-night it is
      stewed carrots and nut tart for supper. Suppose we go in and take our
      places,&rdquo; her sidelong, tragic stare accusing the Professor and me the
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed them across the lawn and up the steps. Frau Godowska was
      murmuring, &ldquo;Such a wonderful, beloved man&rdquo;; with her disengaged hand
      Fräulein Sonia was arranging the sweet-pea &ldquo;garniture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A concert for the benefit of afflicted Catholic infants will take place
      in the salon at eight-thirty P.M. Artists: Fräulein Sonia Godowska, from
      Vienna; Herr Professor Windberg and his trombone; Frau Oberlehrer Weidel,
      and others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This notice was tied round the neck of the melancholy stag&rsquo;s head in the
      dining-room. It graced him like a red and white &ldquo;dinner bib&rdquo; for days
      before the event, causing the Herr Professor to bow before it and say &ldquo;good
      appetite&rdquo; until we sickened of his pleasantry and left the smiling to be
      done by the waiter, who was paid to be pleasing to the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the appointed day the married ladies sailed about the pension dressed
      like upholstered chairs, and the unmarried ladies like draped muslin
      dressing-table covers. Frau Godowska pinned a rose in the centre of her
      reticule; another blossom was tucked in the mazy folds of a white
      antimacassar thrown across her breast. The gentlemen wore black coats,
      white silk ties and ferny buttonholes tickling the chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The floor of the salon was freshly polished, chairs and benches arranged,
      and a row of little flags strung across the ceiling&mdash;they flew and
      jigged in the draught with all the enthusiasm of family washing. It was
      arranged that I should sit beside Frau Godowska, and that the Herr
      Professor and Sonia should join us when their share of the concert was
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will make you feel quite one of the performers,&rdquo; said the Herr
      Professor genially. &ldquo;It is a great pity that the English nation is so
      unmusical. Never mind! To-night you shall hear something&mdash;we have
      discovered a nest of talent during the rehearsals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you intend to recite, Fräulein Sonia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook back her hair. &ldquo;I never know until the last moment. When I come
      on the stage I wait for one moment and then I have the sensation as though
      something struck me here,&rdquo;&mdash;she placed her hand upon her collar
      brooch&mdash;&ldquo;and... words come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bend down a moment,&rdquo; whispered her mother. &ldquo;Sonia, love, your
      skirt safety-pin is showing at the back. Shall I come outside and fasten it
      properly for you, or will you do it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mamma, please don&rsquo;t say such things,&rdquo; Sonia flushed and
      grew very angry. &ldquo;You know how sensitive I am to the slightest unsympathetic
      impression at a time like this.... I would rather my skirt dropped off my
      body&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sonia&mdash;my heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A bell tinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter came in and opened the piano. In the heated excitement of the
      moment he entirely forgot what was fitting, and flicked the keys with the
      grimy table napkin he carried over his arm. The Frau Oberlehrer tripped on
      the platform followed by a very young gentleman, who blew his nose twice
      before he hurled his handkerchief into the bosom of the piano.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Yes, I know you have no love for me,
     And no forget-me-not.
     No love, no heart, and no forget-me-not.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      sang the Frau Oberlehrer, in a voice that seemed to issue from her
      forgotten thimble and have nothing to do with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach, how sweet, how delicate,&rdquo; we cried, clapping her soothingly. She
      bowed as though to say, &ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; and retired, the very young
      gentleman dodging her train and scowling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The piano was closed, an arm-chair was placed in the centre of the
      platform. Fräulein Sonia drifted towards it. A breathless pause. Then,
      presumably, the winged shaft struck her collar brooch. She implored us not
      to go into the woods in trained dresses, but rather as lightly draped as
      possible, and bed with her among the pine needles. Her loud, slightly
      harsh voice filled the salon. She dropped her arms over the back of the
      chair, moving her lean hands from the wrists. We were thrilled and silent.
      The Herr Professor, beside me, abnormally serious, his eyes bulging,
      pulled at his moustache ends. Frau Godowska adopted that peculiarly
      detached attitude of the proud parent. The only soul who remained
      untouched by her appeal was the waiter, who leaned idly against the wall
      of the salon and cleaned his nails with the edge of a programme. He was
      &ldquo;off duty&rdquo; and intended to show it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo; shouted the Herr Professor under cover of tumultuous
      applause, &ldquo;tem-per-ament! There you have it. She is a flame in the heart
      of a lily. I know I am going to play well. It is my turn now. I am
      inspired. Fräulein Sonia&rdquo;&mdash;as that lady returned to us, pale and
      draped in a large shawl&mdash;&ldquo;you are my inspiration. To-night you shall
      be the soul of my trombone. Wait only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To right and left of us people bent over and whispered admiration down
      Fräulein Sonia&rsquo;s neck. She bowed in the grand style.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am always successful,&rdquo; she said to me. &ldquo;You see, when I
      act <i>I am</i>. In Vienna, in the plays of Ibsen we had so many bouquets that
      the cook had three in the kitchen. But it is difficult here. There is so little
      magic. Do you not feel it? There is none of that mysterious perfume which floats
      almost as a visible thing from the souls of the Viennese audiences. My
      spirit starves for want of that.&rdquo; She leaned forward, chin on hand.
      &ldquo;Starves,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor appeared with his trombone, blew into it, held it up to one
      eye, tucked back his shirt cuffs and wallowed in the soul of Sonia
      Godowska. Such a sensation did he create that he was recalled to play a
      Bavarian dance, which he acknowledged was to be taken as a breathing
      exercise rather than an artistic achievement. Frau Godowska kept time to
      it with a fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed the very young gentleman who piped in a tenor voice that he loved
      somebody, &ldquo;with blood in his heart and a thousand pains.&rdquo; Fräulein Sonia
      acted a poison scene with the assistance of her mother&rsquo;s pill vial and the
      arm-chair replaced by a &ldquo;chaise longue&rdquo;; a young girl scratched a lullaby
      on a young fiddle; and the Herr Professor performed the last sacrificial
      rites on the altar of the afflicted children by playing the National
      Anthem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I must put mamma to bed,&rdquo; whispered Fräulein Sonia. &ldquo;But afterwards I
      must take a walk. It is imperative that I free my spirit in the open air
      for a moment. Would you come with me as far as the railway station and
      back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, knock on my door when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the modern soul and I found ourselves together under the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a night!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you know that poem of Sappho about her hands
      in the stars.... I am curiously sapphic. And this is so remarkable&mdash;not
      only am I sapphic, I find in all the works of all the greatest writers,
      especially in their unedited letters, some touch, some sign of myself&mdash;some
      resemblance, some part of myself, like a thousand reflections of my own
      hands in a dark mirror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a bother,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know what you mean by &lsquo;bother&rsquo;; is it rather the
      curse of my genius....&rdquo; She paused suddenly, staring at me. &ldquo;Do you
      know my tragedy?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My tragedy is my mother. Living with her I live with the coffin of my
      unborn aspirations. You heard that about the safety-pin to-night. It may
      seem to you a little thing, but it ruined my three first gestures. They
      were&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impaled on a safety-pin,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, exactly that. And when we are in Vienna I am the victim of moods,
      you know. I long to do wild, passionate things. And mamma says, &lsquo;Please
      pour out my mixture first.&rsquo; Once I remember I flew into a rage and threw a
      washstand jug out of the window. Do you know what she said? &lsquo;Sonia, it is
      not so much throwing things out of windows, if only you would&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choose something smaller?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No... &lsquo;tell me about it beforehand.&rsquo; Humiliating! And I do
      not see any possible light out of this darkness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you join a touring company and leave your mother in Vienna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Leave my poor, little, sick, widowed mother in Vienna! Sooner than
      that I would drown myself. I love my mother as I love nobody else in the
      world&mdash;nobody and nothing! Do you think it is impossible to love
      one&rsquo;s tragedy? &lsquo;Out of my great sorrows I make my little songs,&rsquo; that is
      Heine or myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; I said cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suggested we should turn back. We turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I think the solution lies in marriage,&rdquo; said Fräulein Sonia.
      &ldquo;If I find a simple, peaceful man who adores me and will look after mamma&mdash;a
      man who would be for me a pillow&mdash;for genius cannot hope to mate&mdash;I
      shall marry him.... You know the Herr Professor has paid me very marked
      attentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Fräulein Sonia,&rdquo; I said, very pleased with myself, &ldquo;why not marry him
      to your mother?&rdquo; We were passing the hairdresser&rsquo;s shop at the moment.
      Fräulein Sonia clutched my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, you,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;The cruelty. I am going to faint. Mamma to
      marry again before I marry&mdash;the indignity. I am going to faint here
      and now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was frightened. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said, shaking her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back to the pension and faint as much as you please. But you can&rsquo;t
      faint here. All the shops are closed. There is nobody about. Please don&rsquo;t
      be so foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here and here only!&rdquo; She indicated the exact spot and dropped quite
      beautifully, lying motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;faint away; but please hurry over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not move. I began to walk home, but each time I looked behind me I
      saw the dark form of the modern soul prone before the hairdresser&rsquo;s
      window. Finally I ran, and rooted out the Herr Professor from his room.
      &ldquo;Fräulein Sonia has fainted,&rdquo; I said crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Du lieber Gott! Where? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outside the hairdresser&rsquo;s shop in the Station Road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jesus and Maria! Has she no water with her?&rdquo;&mdash;he seized his carafe&mdash;&ldquo;nobody
      beside her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is my coat? No matter, I shall catch a cold on the chest.
      Willingly, I shall catch one.... You are ready to come with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;you can take the waiter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she must have a woman. I cannot be so indelicate as to attempt to
      loosen her stays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Modern souls oughtn&rsquo;t to wear them,&rdquo; said I. He pushed past me and
      clattered down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>

     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
     </p>
    <p>
      When I came down to breakfast next morning there were two places
      vacant at table. Fräulein Sonia and Herr Professor had gone off for a
      day&rsquo;s excursion in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered.

    <h2>
      7. AT &ldquo;LEHMANN&rsquo;S&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      Certainly Sabina did not find life slow. She was on the trot from early
      morning until late at night. At five o&rsquo;clock she tumbled out of bed,
      buttoned on her clothes, wearing a long-sleeved alpaca pinafore over her
      black frock, and groped her way downstairs into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna, the cook, had grown so fat during the summer that she adored her bed
      because she did not have to wear her corsets there, but could spread as
      much as she liked, roll about under the great mattress, calling upon Jesus
      and Holy Mary and Blessed Anthony himself that her life was not fit for a
      pig in a cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sabina was new to her work. Pink colour still flew in her cheeks; there
      was a little dimple on the left side of her mouth that even when she was
      most serious, most absorbed, popped out and gave her away. And Anna
      blessed that dimple. It meant an extra half-hour in bed for her; it made
      Sabina light the fire, turn out the kitchen and wash endless cups and
      saucers that had been left over from the evening before. Hans, the
      scullery boy, did not come until seven. He was the son of the butcher&mdash;a
      mean, undersized child very much like one of his father&rsquo;s sausages, Sabina
      thought. His red face was covered with pimples, and his nails
      indescribably filthy. When Herr Lehmann himself told Hans to get a hairpin
      and clean them he said they were stained from birth because his mother had
      always got so inky doing the accounts&mdash;and Sabina believed him and
      pitied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winter had come very early to Mindelbau. By the end of October the streets
      were banked waist-high with snow, and the greater number of the &ldquo;Cure
      Guests,&rdquo; sick unto death of cold water and herbs, had departed in nothing
      approaching peace. So the large salon was shut at Lehmann&rsquo;s and the
      breakfast-room was all the accommodation the café afforded. Here the floor
      had to be washed over, the tables rubbed, coffee-cups set out, each with
      its little china platter of sugar, and newspapers and magazines hung on
      their hooks along the walls before Herr Lehmann appeared at seven-thirty
      and opened business.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule his wife served in the shop leading into the café, but she had
      chosen the quiet season to have a baby, and, a big woman at the best of
      times, she had grown so enormous in the process that her husband told her
      she looked unappetising, and had better remain upstairs and sew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sabina took on the extra work without any thought of extra pay. She loved
      to stand behind the counter, cutting up slices of Anna&rsquo;s marvellous
      chocolate-spotted confections, or doing up packets of sugar almonds in
      pink and blue striped bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get varicose veins, like me,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the Frau&rsquo;s
      got, too. No wonder the baby doesn&rsquo;t come! All her swelling&rsquo;s got into her
      legs.&rdquo; And Hans was immensely interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the morning business was comparatively slack. Sabina answered the
      shop bell, attended to a few customers who drank a liqueur to warm their
      stomachs before the midday meal, and ran upstairs now and again to ask the
      Frau if she wanted anything. But in the afternoon six or seven choice
      spirits played cards, and everybody who was anybody drank tea or coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sabina... Sabina....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flew from one table to the other, counting out handfuls of small
      change, giving orders to Anna through the &ldquo;slide,&rdquo; helping the men with
      their heavy coats, always with that magical child air about her, that
      delightful sense of perpetually attending a party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the Frau Lehmann?&rdquo; the women would whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She feels rather low, but as well as can be expected,&rdquo; Sabina would
      answer, nodding confidentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frau Lehmann&rsquo;s bad time was approaching. Anna and her friends referred to
      it as her &ldquo;journey to Rome,&rdquo; and Sabina longed to ask questions, yet,
      being ashamed of her ignorance, was silent, trying to puzzle it out for
      herself. She knew practically nothing except that the Frau had a baby
      inside her, which had to come out&mdash;very painful indeed. One could not
      have one without a husband&mdash;that she also realised. But what had the
      man got to do with it? So she wondered as she sat mending tea towels in
      the evening, head bent over her work, light shining on her brown curls.
      Birth&mdash;what was it? wondered Sabina. Death&mdash;such a simple thing.
      She had a little picture of her dead grandmother dressed in a black silk
      frock, tired hands clasping the crucifix that dragged between her
      flattened breasts, mouth curiously tight, yet almost secretly smiling. But
      the grandmother had been born once&mdash;that was the important fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sat there one evening, thinking, the Young Man entered the café,
      and called for a glass of port wine. Sabina rose slowly. The long day and
      the hot room made her feel a little languid, but as she poured out the
      wine she felt the Young Man&rsquo;s eyes fixed on her, looked down at him and
      dimpled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold out,&rdquo; she said, corking the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Young Man ran his hands through his snow-powdered hair and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call it exactly tropical,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re very snug in
      here&mdash;look as though you&rsquo;ve been asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very languid felt Sabina in the hot room, and the Young Man&rsquo;s voice was
      strong and deep. She thought she had never seen anybody who looked so
      strong&mdash;as though he could take up the table in one hand&mdash;and
      his restless gaze wandering over her face and figure gave her a curious
      thrill deep in her body, half pleasure, half pain.... She wanted to stand
      there, close beside him, while he drank his wine. A little silence
      followed. Then he took a book out of his pocket, and Sabina went back to
      her sewing. Sitting there in the corner, she listened to the sound of the
      leaves being turned and the loud ticking of the clock that hung over the
      gilt mirror. She wanted to look at him again&mdash;there was a something
      about him, in his deep voice, even in the way his clothes fitted. From the
      room above she heard the heavy dragging sound of Frau Lehmann&rsquo;s footsteps,
      and again the old thoughts worried Sabina. If she herself should one day
      look like that&mdash;feel like that! Yet it would be very sweet to have a
      little baby to dress and jump up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fräulein&mdash;what&rsquo;s your name&mdash;what are you smiling at?&rdquo; called
      the Young Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She blushed and looked up, hands quiet in her lap, looked across the empty
      tables and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, and I&rsquo;ll show you a picture,&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went and stood beside him. He opened the book, and Sabina saw a
      coloured sketch of a naked girl sitting on the edge of a great, crumpled
      bed, a man&rsquo;s opera hat on the back of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand over the body, leaving only the face exposed, then
      scrutinised Sabina closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked, knowing perfectly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it might be your own photograph&mdash;the face, I mean&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      as far as I can judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the hair&rsquo;s done differently,&rdquo; said Sabina, laughing. She threw back
      her head, and the laughter bubbled in her round white throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a nice picture, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; he asked. But she was
      looking at a curious ring he wore on the hand that covered the girl&rsquo;s
      body, and only nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever seen anything like it before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s plenty of those funny ones in the illustrated papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you like to have your picture taken that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? I&rsquo;d never let anybody see it. Besides, I haven&rsquo;t got a hat like
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easily remedied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again a little silence, broken by Anna throwing up the slide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sabina ran into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, take this milk and egg up to the Frau,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ve you got
      in there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got such a funny man! I think he&rsquo;s a little gone here,&rdquo; tapping her
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs in the ugly room the Frau sat sewing, a black shawl round her
      shoulders, her feet encased in red woollen slippers. The girl put the milk
      on a table by her, then stood, polishing a spoon on her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na,&rdquo; said the Frau, heaving up in her chair. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s playing cards over at Snipold&rsquo;s. Do you want him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heaven, leave him alone. I&rsquo;m nothing. I don&rsquo;t
      matter.... And the whole day waiting here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand shook as she wiped the rim of the glass with her fat finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I help you to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go downstairs, leave me alone. Tell Anna not to let Hans grub the
      sugar&mdash;give him one on the ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugly&mdash;ugly&mdash;ugly,&rdquo; muttered Sabina, returning to the café
      where the Young Man stood coat-buttoned, ready for departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come again to-morrow,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t twist your hair back so
      tightly; it will lose all its curl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are a funny one,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time Sabina was ready for bed Anna was snoring. She brushed out her
      long hair and gathered it in her hands.... Perhaps it would be a pity if it
      lost all its curl. Then she looked down at her straight chemise, and
      drawing it off, sat down on the side of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she whispered, smiling sleepily, &ldquo;there was a great big
      looking-glass in this room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lying down in the darkness, she hugged her little body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be the Frau for one hundred marks&mdash;not for a thousand
      marks. To look like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And half-dreaming, she imagined herself heaving up in her chair with the
      port wine bottle in her hand as the Young Man entered the café.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cold and dark the next morning. Sabina woke, tired, feeling as though
      something heavy had been pressing under her heart all night. There was a
      sound of footsteps shuffling along the passage. Herr Lehmann! She must
      have overslept herself. Yes, he was rattling the door-handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, one moment,&rdquo; she called, dragging on her stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bina, tell Anna to go to the Frau&mdash;but quickly. I must ride for the
      nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Has it come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had gone, and she ran over to Anna and shook her by the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Frau&mdash;the baby&mdash;Herr Lehmann for the nurse,&rdquo; she stuttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name of God!&rdquo; said Anna, flinging herself out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      No complaints to-day. Importance&mdash;enthusiasm in Anna&rsquo;s whole bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You run downstairs and light the oven. Put on a pan of water&rdquo;&mdash;speaking
      to an imaginary sufferer as she fastened her blouse&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, yes, I
      know&mdash;we must be worse before we are better&mdash;I&rsquo;m coming&mdash;patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was dark all that day. Lights were turned on immediately the café
      opened, and business was very brisk. Anna, turned out of the Frau&rsquo;s room
      by the nurse, refused to work, and sat in a corner nursing herself,
      listening to sounds overhead. Hans was more sympathetic than Sabina. He
      also forsook work, and stood by the window, picking his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why must I do everything?&rdquo; said Sabina, washing glasses. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      help the Frau; she oughtn&rsquo;t to take such a time about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Anna, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve moved her into the back bedroom above here,
      so as not to disturb the people. That was a groan&mdash;that one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two small beers,&rdquo; shouted Herr Lehmann through the slide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, one moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock the café was deserted. Sabina sat down in the corner
      without her sewing. Nothing seemed to have happened to the Frau. A doctor
      had come&mdash;that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach,&rdquo; said Sabina. &ldquo;I think no more of it. I listen no more. Ach, I would
      like to go away&mdash;I hate this talk. I will not hear it. No, it is too
      much.&rdquo; She leaned both elbows on the table&mdash;cupped her face in her
      hands and pouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the outer door suddenly opening, she sprang to her feet and laughed.
      It was the Young Man again. He ordered more port, and brought no book this
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go and sit miles away,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;I want to be amused. And
      here, take my coat. Can&rsquo;t you dry it somewhere?&mdash;snowing again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a warm place&mdash;the ladies&rsquo; cloak-room,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take
      it in there&mdash;just by the kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt better, and quite happy again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see where you put it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that did not seem at all extraordinary. She laughed and beckoned to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In here,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Feel how warm. I&rsquo;ll put more wood on that oven. It
      doesn&rsquo;t matter, they&rsquo;re all busy upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knelt down on the floor, and thrust the wood into the oven, laughing
      at her own wicked extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frau was forgotten, the stupid day was forgotten. Here was someone
      beside her laughing, too. They were together in the little warm room
      stealing Herr Lehmann&rsquo;s wood. It seemed the most exciting adventure in the
      world. She wanted to go on laughing&mdash;or burst out crying&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;catch
      hold of the Young Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fire,&rdquo; she shrieked, stretching out her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a hand; pull up,&rdquo; said the Young Man. &ldquo;There, now, you&rsquo;ll catch it
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood opposite to each other, hands still clinging. And again that
      strange tremor thrilled Sabina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said roughly, &ldquo;are you a child, or are you playing at
      being one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laughter ceased. She looked up at him once, then down at the floor, and
      began breathing like a frightened little animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled her closer still and kissed her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, what are you doing?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He let go her hands, he placed his on her breasts, and the room seemed to
      swim round Sabina. Suddenly, from the room above, a frightful, tearing
      shriek.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrenched herself away, tightened herself, drew herself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did that&mdash;who made that noise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
     </p>
     <p>
      In the silence the thin wailing of a baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Achk!&rdquo; shrieked Sabina, rushing from the room.

      8. THE LUFT BAD
    </h2>
    <p>
      I think it must be the umbrellas which make us look ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was admitted into the enclosure for the first time, and saw my
      fellow-bathers walking about very nearly &ldquo;in their nakeds,&rdquo; it struck me
      that the umbrellas gave a distinctly &ldquo;Little Black Sambo&rdquo; touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ridiculous dignity in holding over yourself a green cotton thing with a
      red parroquet handle when you are dressed in nothing larger than a
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no trees in the &ldquo;Luft Bad.&rdquo; It boasts a collection of plain,
      wooden cells, a bath shelter, two swings and two odd clubs&mdash;one,
      presumably the lost property of Hercules or the German army, and the other
      to be used with safety in the cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there in all weathers we take the air&mdash;walking, or sitting in
      little companies talking over each other&rsquo;s ailments and measurements and
      ills that flesh is heir to.
    </p>
    <p>
      A high wooden wall compasses us all about; above it the pine-trees look
      down a little superciliously, nudging each other in a way that is
      peculiarly trying to a <i>débutante</i>. Over the wall, on the right side, is the
      men&rsquo;s section. We hear them chopping down trees and sawing through planks,
      dashing heavy weights to the ground, and singing part songs. Yes, they
      take it far more seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first day I was conscious of my legs, and went back into my cell
      three times to look at my watch, but when a woman with whom I had played
      chess for three weeks cut me dead, I took heart and joined a circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      We lay curled on the ground while a Hungarian lady of immense proportions
      told us what a beautiful tomb she had bought for her second husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vault it is,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with nice black railings. And so large that I
      can go down there and walk about. Both their photographs are there, with
      two very handsome wreaths sent me by my first husband&rsquo;s brother. There is
      an enlargement of a family group photograph, too, and an illuminated
      address presented to my first husband on his marriage. I am often there;
      it makes such a pleasant excursion for a fine Saturday afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly lay down flat on her back, took in six long breaths, and sat
      up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The death agony was dreadful,&rdquo; she said brightly; &ldquo;of the second, I mean.
      The &lsquo;first&rsquo; was run into by a furniture wagon, and had fifty marks stolen
      out of a new waistcoat pocket, but the &lsquo;second&rsquo; was dying for sixty-seven
      hours. I never ceased crying once&mdash;not even to put the children to
      bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A young Russian, with a &ldquo;bang&rdquo; curl on her forehead, turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you do the &lsquo;Salome&rsquo; dance?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I do it now? Would you like to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet, executed a series of amazing contortions for the
      next ten minutes, and then paused, panting, twisting her long hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that nice?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And now I am perspiring so splendidly. I
      shall go and take a bath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Opposite to me was the brownest woman I have ever seen, lying on her back,
      her arms clasped over her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been here to-day?&rdquo; she was asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I spend the day here now,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I am making my own &lsquo;cure,&rsquo;
      and living entirely on raw vegetables and nuts, and each day I feel my
      spirit is stronger and purer. After all, what can you expect? The majority
      of us are walking about with pig corpuscles and oxen fragments in our
      brain. The wonder is the world is as good as it is. Now I live on the
      simple, provided food&rdquo;&mdash;she pointed to a little bag beside her&mdash;&ldquo;a
      lettuce, a carrot, a potato, and some nuts are ample, rational
      nourishment. I wash them under the tap and eat them raw, just as they come
      from the harmless earth&mdash;fresh and uncontaminated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you take nothing else all day?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water. And perhaps a banana if I wake in the night.&rdquo; She turned round and
      leaned on one elbow. &ldquo;You over-eat yourself dreadfully,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;shamelessly! How can you expect the Flame of the Spirit to burn brightly
      under layers of superfluous flesh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wished she would not stare at me, and thought of going to look at my
      watch again when a little girl wearing a string of coral beads joined us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor Frau Hauptmann cannot join us to-day,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;she has come
      out in spots all over on account of her nerves. She was very excited
      yesterday after having written two post-cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A delicate woman,&rdquo; volunteered the Hungarian, &ldquo;but pleasant. Fancy, she
      has a separate plate for each of her front teeth! But she has no right to
      let her daughters wear such short sailor suits. They sit about on benches,
      crossing their legs in a most shameless manner. What are you going to do
      this afternoon, Fräulein Anna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Coral Necklace, &ldquo;the Herr Oberleutnant has asked me to go
      with him to Landsdorf. He must buy some eggs there to take home to his
      mother. He saves a penny on eight eggs by knowing the right peasants to
      bargain with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you an American?&rdquo; said the Vegetable Lady, turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are an Englishwoman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hardly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be one of the two; you cannot help it. I have seen you walking
      alone several times. You wear your&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I got up and climbed on to the swing. The air was sweet and cool, rushing
      past my body. Above, white clouds trailed delicately through the blue sky.
      From the pine forest streamed a wild perfume, the branches swayed
      together, rhythmically, sonorously. I felt so light and free and happy&mdash;so
      childish! I wanted to poke my tongue out at the circle on the grass, who,
      drawing close together, were whispering meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you do not know,&rdquo; cried a voice from one of the cells, &ldquo;to swing
      is very upsetting for the stomach? A friend of mine could keep nothing
      down for three weeks after exciting herself so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went to the bath shelter and was hosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I dressed, someone tapped on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said a voice, &ldquo;there is a man who <i>lives</i> in
      the Luft Bad next door? He buries himself up to the armpits in mud and refuses to
      believe in the Trinity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The umbrellas are the saving grace of the Luft Bad. Now when I go, I take
      my husband&rsquo;s &ldquo;storm gamp&rdquo; and sit in a corner, hiding behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that I am in the least ashamed of my legs.

    <h2>
      9. A BIRTHDAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Andreas Binzer woke slowly. He turned over on the narrow bed and stretched
      himself&mdash;yawned&mdash;opening his mouth as widely as possible and
      bringing his teeth together afterwards with a sharp &ldquo;click.&rdquo; The sound of
      that click fascinated him; he repeated it quickly several times, with a
      snapping movement of the jaws. What teeth! he thought. Sound as a bell,
      every man jack of them. Never had one out, never had one stopped. That
      comes of no tomfoolery in eating, and a good regular brushing night and
      morning. He raised himself on his left elbow and waved his right arm over
      the side of the bed to feel for the chair where he put his watch and chain
      overnight. No chair was there&mdash;of course, he&rsquo;d forgotten, there
      wasn&rsquo;t a chair in this wretched spare room. Had to put the confounded
      thing under his pillow. &ldquo;Half-past eight, Sunday, breakfast at nine&mdash;time
      for the bath&rdquo;&mdash;his brain ticked to the watch. He sprang out of bed
      and went over to the window. The venetian blind was broken, hung
      fan-shaped over the upper pane.... &ldquo;That blind must be mended. I&rsquo;ll get
      the office boy to drop in and fix it on his way home to-morrow&mdash;he&rsquo;s a
      good hand at blinds. Give him twopence and he&rsquo;ll do it as well as a
      carpenter.... Anna could do it herself if she was all right. So would I,
      for the matter of that, but I don&rsquo;t like to trust myself on rickety
      step-ladders.&rdquo; He looked up at the sky: it shone, strangely white,
      unflecked with cloud; he looked down at the row of garden strips and
      backyards. The fence of these gardens was built along the edge of a gully,
      spanned by an iron suspension bridge, and the people had a wretched habit
      of throwing their empty tins over the fence into the gully. Just like
      them, of course! Andreas started counting the tins, and decided,
      viciously, to write a letter to the papers about it and sign it&mdash;sign
      it in full.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant girl came out of their back door into the yard, carrying his
      boots. She threw one down on the ground, thrust her hand into the other,
      and stared at it, sucking in her cheeks. Suddenly she bent forward, spat
      on the toecap, and started polishing with a brush rooted out of her apron
      pocket.... &ldquo;Slut of a girl! Heaven knows what infectious disease may be
      breeding now in that boot. Anna must get rid of that girl&mdash;even if
      she has to do without one for a bit&mdash;as soon as she&rsquo;s up and about
      again. The way she chucked one boot down and then spat upon the other! She
      didn&rsquo;t care whose boots she&rsquo;d got hold of. <i>She</i> had no false
      notions of the respect due to the master of the house.&rdquo; He turned away
      from the window and switched his bath towel from the washstand rail, sick at
      heart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too sensitive for a man&mdash;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
      the matter with me. Have been from the beginning, and will be to the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a gentle knock at the door and his mother came in. She closed
      the door after her and leant against it. Andreas noticed that her cap was
      crooked, and a long tail of hair hung over her shoulder. He went forward
      and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, mother; how&rsquo;s Anna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman spoke quickly, clasping and unclasping her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andreas, please go to Doctor Erb as soon as you are dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is she bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frau Binzer nodded, and Andreas, watching her, saw her face suddenly
      change; a fine network of wrinkles seemed to pull over it from under the
      skin surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down on the bed a moment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Been up all night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. No, I won&rsquo;t sit down, I must go back to her. Anna has been in pain
      all night. She wouldn&rsquo;t have you disturbed before because she said you
      looked so run down yesterday. You told her you had caught a cold and been
      very worried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Straightway Andreas felt that he was being accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she made me tell her, worried it out of me; you know the way she
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Frau Binzer nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I know. She says, is your cold better, and there&rsquo;s a warm
      undervest for you in the left-hand corner of the big drawer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite automatically Andreas cleared his throat twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Tell her my throat certainly feels looser.
      I suppose I&rsquo;d better not disturb her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and besides, <i>time</i>, Andreas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be ready in five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went into the passage. As Frau Binzer opened the door of the front
      bedroom, a long wail came from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      That shocked and terrified Andreas. He dashed into the bathroom, turned on
      both taps as far as they would go, cleaned his teeth and pared his nails
      while the water was running.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frightful business, frightful business,&rdquo; he heard himself whispering.
      &ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t understand it. It isn&rsquo;t as though it were her first&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      her third. Old Schäfer told me, yesterday, his wife simply &lsquo;dropped&rsquo; her
      fourth. Anna ought to have had a qualified nurse. Mother gives way to her.
      Mother spoils her. I wonder what she meant by saying I&rsquo;d worried Anna
      yesterday. Nice remark to make to a husband at a time like this. Unstrung,
      I suppose&mdash;and my sensitiveness again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he went into the kitchen for his boots, the servant girl was bent
      over the stove, cooking breakfast. &ldquo;Breathing into that, now, I suppose,&rdquo;
       thought Andreas, and was very short with the servant girl. She did not
      notice. She was full of terrified joy and importance in the goings on
      upstairs. She felt she was learning the secrets of life with every breath
      she drew. Had laid the table that morning saying, &ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; as she put down
      the first dish, &ldquo;Girl,&rdquo; as she placed the second&mdash;it had worked out
      with the saltspoon to &ldquo;Boy.&rdquo; &ldquo;For two pins I&rsquo;d tell the master that, to
      comfort him, like,&rdquo; she decided. But the master gave her no opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put an extra cup and saucer on the table,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the
      doctor may want some coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor, sir?&rdquo; The servant girl whipped a spoon out of a pan, and
      spilt two drops of grease on the stove. &ldquo;Shall I fry something extra?&rdquo; But
      the master had gone, slamming the door after him. He walked down the
      street&mdash;there was nobody about at all&mdash;dead and alive this place
      on a Sunday morning. As he crossed the suspension bridge a strong stench
      of fennel and decayed refuse streamed from the gulley, and again Andreas
      began concocting a letter. He turned into the main road. The shutters were
      still up before the shops. Scraps of newspaper, hay, and fruit skins
      strewed the pavement; the gutters were choked with the leavings of
      Saturday night. Two dogs sprawled in the middle of the road, scuffling and
      biting. Only the public-house at the corner was open; a young barman
      slopped water over the doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fastidiously, his lips curling, Andreas picked his way through the water.
      &ldquo;Extraordinary how I am noticing things this morning. It&rsquo;s partly the
      effect of Sunday. I loathe a Sunday when Anna&rsquo;s tied by the leg and the
      children are away. On Sunday a man has the right to expect his family.
      Everything here&rsquo;s filthy, the whole place might be down with the plague,
      and will be, too, if this street&rsquo;s not swept away. I&rsquo;d like to have a hand
      on the government ropes.&rdquo; He braced his shoulders. &ldquo;Now for this doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Erb is at breakfast,&rdquo; the maid informed him. She showed him into
      the waiting-room, a dark and musty place, with some ferns under a
      glass-case by the window. &ldquo;He says he won&rsquo;t be a minute, please, sir, and
      there is a paper on the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhealthy hole,&rdquo; thought Binzer, walking over to the window and drumming
      his fingers on the glass fern-shade. &ldquo;At breakfast, is he? That&rsquo;s the
      mistake I made: turning out early on an empty stomach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A milk cart rattled down the street, the driver standing at the back,
      cracking a whip; he wore an immense geranium flower stuck in the lapel of
      his coat. Firm as a rock he stood, bending back a little in the swaying
      cart. Andreas craned his neck to watch him all the way down the road, even
      after he had gone, listening for the sharp sound of those rattling cans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m, not much wrong with him,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t mind a taste of
      that life myself. Up early, work all over by eleven o&rsquo;clock, nothing to do
      but loaf about all day until milking time.&rdquo; Which he knew was an
      exaggeration, but he wanted to pity himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid opened the door, and stood aside for Doctor Erb. Andreas wheeled
      round; the two men shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Binzer,&rdquo; said the doctor jovially, brushing some crumbs from a
      pearl-coloured waistcoat, &ldquo;son and heir becoming importunate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up went Binzer&rsquo;s spirits with a bound. Son and heir, by Jove! He was glad
      to have to deal with a man again. And a sane fellow this, who came across
      this sort of thing every day of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the measure of it, Doctor,&rdquo; he answered, smiling and picking
      up his hat. &ldquo;Mother dragged me out of bed this morning with imperative
      orders to bring you along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gig will be round in a minute. Drive back with me, won&rsquo;t you?
      Extraordinary, sultry day; you&rsquo;re as red as a beetroot already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andreas affected to laugh. The doctor had one annoying habit&mdash;imagined
      he had the right to poke fun at everybody simply because he was a doctor.
      &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s riddled with conceit, like all these professionals,&rdquo; Andreas
      decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of night did Frau Binzer have?&rdquo; asked the doctor. &ldquo;Ah, here&rsquo;s
      the gig. Tell me on the way up. Sit as near the middle as you can, will
      you, Binzer? Your weight tilts it over a bit one side&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
      worst of you successful business men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two stone heavier than I, if he&rsquo;s a pound,&rdquo; thought Andreas. &ldquo;The man may
      be all right in his profession&mdash;but heaven preserve me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off you go, my beauty.&rdquo; Doctor Erb flicked the little brown mare. &ldquo;Did
      your wife get any sleep last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t think she did,&rdquo; answered Andreas shortly. &ldquo;To tell you the
      truth, I&rsquo;m not satisfied that she hasn&rsquo;t a nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your mother&rsquo;s worth a dozen nurses,&rdquo; cried the doctor, with
      immense gusto. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m not keen on nurses&mdash;too
      raw&mdash;raw as rump-steak. They wrestle for a baby as though they were wrestling
      with Death for the body of Patroclus.... Ever seen that picture by an English
      artist. Leighton? Wonderful thing&mdash;full of sinew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he goes again,&rdquo; thought Andreas, &ldquo;airing off his knowledge to make
      a fool of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now your mother&mdash;she&rsquo;s firm&mdash;she&rsquo;s capable. Does what she&rsquo;s
      told with a fund of sympathy. Look at these shops we&rsquo;re passing&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      festering sores. How on earth this government can tolerate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not so bad&mdash;sound enough&mdash;only want a coat of paint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor whistled a little tune and flicked the mare again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope the young shaver won&rsquo;t give his mother too much trouble,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Here we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A skinny little boy, who had been sliding up and down the back seat of the
      gig, sprang out and held the horse&rsquo;s head. Andreas went straight into the
      dining-room and left the servant girl to take the doctor upstairs. He sat
      down, poured out some coffee, and bit through half a roll before helping
      himself to fish. Then he noticed there was no hot plate for the fish&mdash;the
      whole house was at sixes and sevens. He rang the bell, but the servant
      girl came in with a tray holding a bowl of soup and a hot plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been keeping them on the stove,&rdquo; she simpered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, thanks, that&rsquo;s very kind of you.&rdquo; As he swallowed the soup his heart
      warmed to this fool of a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a good thing Doctor Erb has come,&rdquo; volunteered the servant girl,
      who was bursting for want of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m, h&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Andreas.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited a moment, expectantly, rolling her eyes, then in full loathing
      of menkind went back to the kitchen and vowed herself to sterility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andreas cleared the soup bowl, and cleared the fish. As he ate, the room
      slowly darkened. A faint wind sprang up and beat the tree branches against
      the window. The dining-room looked over the breakwater of the harbour, and
      the sea swung heavily in rolling waves. Wind crept round the house,
      moaning drearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for a storm. That means I&rsquo;m boxed up here all day.
      Well, there&rsquo;s one blessing; it&rsquo;ll clear the air.&rdquo; He heard the
      servant girl rushing importantly round the house, slamming windows. Then he caught
      a glimpse of her in the garden, unpegging tea towels from the line across the
      lawn. She was a worker, there was no doubt about that. He took up a book, and
      wheeled his arm-chair over to the window. But it was useless. Too dark to
      read; he didn&rsquo;t believe in straining his eyes, and gas at ten o&rsquo;clock in
      the morning seemed absurd. So he slipped down in the chair, leaned his
      elbows on the padded arms and gave himself up, for once, to idle dreaming.
      &ldquo;A boy? Yes, it was bound to be a boy this time....&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your family,
      Binzer?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve two girls and a boy!&rdquo; A very nice little number. Of
      course he was the last man to have a favourite child, but a man needed a
      son. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working up the business for my son! Binzer &amp; Son! It would
      mean living very tight for the next ten years, cutting expenses as fine as
      possible; and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tremendous gust of wind sprang upon the house, seized it, shook it,
      dropped, only to grip the more tightly. The waves swelled up along the
      breakwater and were whipped with broken foam. Over the white sky flew
      tattered streamers of grey cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andreas felt quite relieved to hear Doctor Erb coming down the stairs; he
      got up and lit the gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind if I smoke in here?&rdquo; asked Doctor Erb, lighting a cigarette before
      Andreas had time to answer. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t smoke, do you? No time to indulge
      in pernicious little habits!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is she now?&rdquo; asked Andreas, loathing the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well as can be expected, poor little soul. She begged me to come down
      and have a look at you. Said she knew you were worrying.&rdquo; With laughing
      eyes the doctor looked at the breakfast-table. &ldquo;Managed to peck a bit, I
      see, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoo-wih!&rdquo; shouted the wind, shaking the window-sashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity&mdash;this weather,&rdquo; said Doctor Erb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it gets on Anna&rsquo;s nerves, and it&rsquo;s just nerve she wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; retorted the doctor. &ldquo;Nerve! Man alive! She&rsquo;s got twice
      the nerve of you and me rolled into one. Nerve! she&rsquo;s nothing but nerve. A
      woman who works as she does about the house and has three children in four
      years thrown in with the dusting, so to speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pitched his half-smoked cigarette into the fireplace and frowned at the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now <i>he&rsquo;s</i> accusing me,&rdquo; thought Andreas. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the second time this
      morning&mdash;first mother and now this man taking advantage of my
      sensitiveness.&rdquo; He could not trust himself to speak, and rang the bell for
      the servant girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clear away the breakfast things,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have them messing
      about on the table till dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hard on the girl,&rdquo; coaxed Doctor Erb. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got twice the work
      to do to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that Binzer&rsquo;s anger blazed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble you, Doctor, not to interfere between me and my servants!&rdquo;
       And he felt a fool at the same moment for not saying &ldquo;servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Erb was not perturbed. He shook his head, thrust his hands into his
      pockets, and began balancing himself on toe and heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re jagged by the weather,&rdquo; he said wryly, &ldquo;nothing else. A great pity&mdash;this
      storm. You know climate has an immense effect upon birth. A fine day perks
      a woman&mdash;gives her heart for her business. Good weather is as
      necessary to a confinement as it is to a washing day. Not bad&mdash;that
      last remark of mine&mdash;for a professional fossil, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andreas made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be getting back to my patient. Why don&rsquo;t you take a walk, and
      clear your head? That&rsquo;s the idea for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do that; it&rsquo;s too rough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went back to his chair by the window. While the servant girl cleared
      away he pretended to read... then his dreams! It seemed years since he had
      had the time to himself to dream like that&mdash;he never had a breathing
      space. Saddled with work all day, and couldn&rsquo;t shake it off in the evening
      like other men. Besides, Anna was interested&mdash;they talked of
      practically nothing else together. Excellent mother she&rsquo;d make for a boy;
      she had a grip of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Church bells started ringing through the windy air, now sounding as though
      from very far away, then again as though all the churches in the town had
      been suddenly transplanted into their street. They stirred something in
      him, those bells, something vague and tender. Just about that time Anna
      would call him from the hall. &ldquo;Andreas, come and have your coat brushed.
      I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo; Then off they would go, she hanging on his arm, and looking up
      at him. She certainly was a little thing. He remembered once saying when
      they were engaged, &ldquo;Just as high as my heart,&rdquo; and she had jumped on to a
      stool and pulled his head down, laughing. A kid in those days, younger
      than her children in nature, brighter, more &ldquo;go&rdquo; and &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; in her. The
      way she&rsquo;d run down the road to meet him after business! And the way she
      laughed when they were looking for a house. By Jove! that laugh of hers!
      At the memory he grinned, then grew suddenly grave. Marriage certainly
      changed a woman far more than it did a man. Talk about sobering down. She
      had lost all her go in two months! Well, once this boy business was over
      she&rsquo;d get stronger. He began to plan a little trip for them. He&rsquo;d take her
      away and they&rsquo;d loaf about together somewhere. After all, dash it, they
      were young still. She&rsquo;d got into a groove; he&rsquo;d have to force her out of
      it, that&rsquo;s all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and went into the drawing-room, carefully shut the door and took
      Anna&rsquo;s photograph from the top of the piano. She wore a white dress with a
      big bow of some soft stuff under the chin, and stood, a little stiffly,
      holding a sheaf of artificial poppies and corn in her hands. Delicate she
      looked even then; her masses of hair gave her that look. She seemed to
      droop under the heavy braids of it, and yet she was smiling. Andreas
      caught his breath sharply. She was his wife&mdash;that girl. Posh! it had
      only been taken four years ago. He held it close to him, bent forward and
      kissed it. Then rubbed the glass with the back of his hand. At that
      moment, fainter than he had heard in the passage, more terrifying, Andreas
      heard again that wailing cry. The wind caught it up in mocking echo, blew
      it over the house-tops, down the street, far away from him. He flung out
      his arms, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so damnably helpless,&rdquo; he said, and then, to the picture,
      &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s not as bad as it sounds; perhaps it is just my
      sensitiveness.&rdquo; In the half light of the drawing-room the smile seemed to
      deepen in Anna&rsquo;s portrait, and to become secret, even cruel. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
      reflected, &ldquo;that smile is not at all her happiest expression&mdash;it was
      a mistake to let her have it taken smiling like that. She doesn&rsquo;t look
      like my wife&mdash;like the mother of my son.&rdquo; Yes, that was it, she did
      not look like the mother of a son who was going to be a partner in the
      firm. The picture got on his nerves; he held it in different lights,
      looked at it from a distance, sideways, spent, it seemed to Andreas
      afterwards, a whole lifetime trying to fit it in. The more he played with
      it the deeper grew his dislike of it. Thrice he carried it over to the
      fireplace and decided to chuck it behind the Japanese umbrella in the
      grate; then he thought it absurd to waste an expensive frame. There was no
      good in beating about the bush. Anna looked like a stranger&mdash;abnormal,
      a freak&mdash;it might be a picture taken just before or after death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he realised that the wind had dropped, that the whole house was
      still, terribly still. Cold and pale, with a disgusting feeling that
      spiders were creeping up his spine and across his face, he stood in the
      centre of the drawing-room, hearing Doctor Erb&rsquo;s footsteps descending the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw Doctor Erb come into the room; the room seemed to change into a
      great glass bowl that spun round, and Doctor Erb seemed to swim through
      this glass bowl towards him, like a goldfish in a pearl-coloured
      waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My beloved wife has passed away!&rdquo; He wanted to shout it out before the
      doctor spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s hooked a boy this time!&rdquo; said Doctor Erb.
      Andreas staggered forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out. Keep on your pins,&rdquo; said Doctor Erb, catching
      Binzer&rsquo;s arm, and murmuring, as he felt it, &ldquo;Flabby as butter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glow spread all over Andreas. He was exultant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by God! Nobody can accuse <i>me</i> of not knowing what
      suffering is,&rdquo; he said.

    <h2>
      10. THE CHILD-WHO-WAS-TIRED
    </h2>
    <p>
      She was just beginning to walk along a little white road with tall black
      trees on either side, a little road that led to nowhere, and where nobody
      walked at all, when a hand gripped her shoulder, shook her, slapped her
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, don&rsquo;t stop me,&rdquo; cried the Child-Who-Was-Tired. &ldquo;Let me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up, you good-for-nothing brat,&rdquo; said a voice; &ldquo;get up and light the
      oven or I&rsquo;ll shake every bone out of your body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an immense effort she opened her eyes, and saw the Frau standing by,
      the baby bundled under one arm. The three other children who shared the
      same bed with the Child-Who-Was-Tired, accustomed to brawls, slept on
      peacefully. In a corner of the room the Man was fastening his braces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by sleeping like this the whole night through&mdash;like
      a sack of potatoes? You&rsquo;ve let the baby wet his bed twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, but tied her petticoat string, and buttoned on her
      plaid frock with cold, shaking fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s enough. Take the baby into the kitchen with you, and heat
      that cold coffee on the spirit lamp for the master, and give him the loaf
      of black bread out of the table drawer. Don&rsquo;t guzzle it yourself or I&rsquo;ll
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frau staggered across the room, flung herself on to her bed, drawing
      the pink bolster round her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost dark in the kitchen. She laid the baby on the wooden settle,
      covering him with a shawl, then poured the coffee from the earthenware jug
      into the saucepan, and set it on the spirit lamp to boil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sleepy,&rdquo; nodded the Child-Who-Was-Tired, kneeling on the floor and
      splitting the damp pine logs into little chips. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not
      awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The oven took a long time to light. Perhaps it was cold, like herself, and
      sleepy.... Perhaps it had been dreaming of a little white road with black
      trees on either side, a little road that led to nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the door was pulled violently open and the Man strode in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, what are you doing, sitting on the floor?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Give me my
      coffee. I&rsquo;ve got to be off. Ugh! You haven&rsquo;t even washed over the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet, poured his coffee into an enamel cup, and gave him
      bread and a knife, then, taking a wash rag from the sink, smeared over the
      black linoleumed table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swine of a day&mdash;swine&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; mumbled the Man, sitting by the table
      and staring out of the window at the bruised sky, which seemed to bulge
      heavily over the dull land. He stuffed his mouth with bread and then
      swilled it down with the coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Child drew a pail of water, turned up her sleeves, frowning the while
      at her arms, as if to scold them for being so thin, so much like little
      stunted twigs, and began to mop over the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop sousing about the water while I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; grumbled the Man. &ldquo;Stop the
      baby snivelling; it&rsquo;s been going on like that all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Child gathered the baby into her lap and sat rocking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ts&mdash;ts&mdash;ts,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s cutting his eye teeth, that&rsquo;s what
      makes him cry so. <i>And</i> dribble&mdash;I never seen a baby dribble like this
      one.&rdquo; She wiped his mouth and nose with a corner of her skirt. &ldquo;Some
      babies get their teeth without you knowing it,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;and some
      take on this way all the time. I once heard of a baby that died, and they
      found all its teeth in its stomach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Man got up, unhooked his cloak from the back of the door, and flung it
      round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another coming,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;a tooth!&rdquo; exclaimed the Child, startled for the first time
      that morning out of her dreadful heaviness, and thrusting her finger into
      the baby&rsquo;s mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;another baby. Now, get on with your work; it&rsquo;s time
      the others got up for school.&rdquo; She stood a moment quite silently, hearing
      his heavy steps on the stone passage, then the gravel walk, and finally
      the slam of the front gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another baby! Hasn&rsquo;t she finished having them <i>yet?</i>&rdquo; thought the Child.
      &ldquo;Two babies getting eye teeth&mdash;two babies to get up for in the night&mdash;two
      babies to carry about and wash their little piggy clothes!&rdquo; She looked
      with horror at the one in her arms, who, seeming to understand the
      contemptuous loathing of her tired glance, doubled his fists, stiffened
      his body, and began violently screaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ts&mdash;ts&mdash;ts.&rdquo; She laid him on the settle and went back to her
      floor-washing. He never ceased crying for a moment, but she got quite used
      to it and kept time with her broom. Oh, how tired she was! Oh, the heavy
      broom handle and the burning spot just at the back of her neck that ached
      so, and a funny little fluttering feeling just at the back of her
      waistband, as though something were going to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck six. She set the pan of milk in the oven, and went into
      the next room to wake and dress the three children. Anton and Hans lay
      together in attitudes of mutual amity which certainly never existed out of
      their sleeping hours. Lena was curled up, her knees under her chin, only a
      straight, standing-up pigtail of hair showing above the bolster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; cried the Child, speaking in a voice of immense authority,
      pulling off the bedclothes and giving the boys sundry pokes and digs.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been calling you this last half-hour. It&rsquo;s late, and I&rsquo;ll tell on
      you if you don&rsquo;t get dressed this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anton awoke sufficiently to turn over and kick Hans on a tender part,
      whereupon Hans pulled Lena&rsquo;s pigtail until she shrieked for her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do be quiet,&rdquo; whispered the Child. &ldquo;Oh, do get up and dress. You know
      what will happen. There&mdash;I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the warning came too late. The Frau got out of bed, walked in a
      determined fashion into the kitchen, returning with a bundle of twigs in
      her hand fastened together with a strong cord. One by one she laid the
      children across her knee and severely beat them, expending a final burst
      of energy on the Child-Who-Was-Tired, then returned to bed, with a
      comfortable sense of her maternal duties in good working order for the
      day. Very subdued, the three allowed themselves to be dressed and washed
      by the Child, who even laced the boys&rsquo; boots, having found through
      experience that if left to themselves they hopped about for at least five
      minutes to find a comfortable ledge for their foot, and then spat on their
      hands and broke the bootlaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she gave them their breakfast they became uproarious, and the baby
      would not cease crying. When she filled the tin kettle with milk, tied on
      the rubber teat, and, first moistening it herself, tried with little
      coaxing words to make him drink, he threw the bottle on to the floor and
      trembled all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eye teeth!&rdquo; shouted Hans, hitting Anton over the head with his empty cup;
      &ldquo;he&rsquo;s getting the evil-eye teeth, I should say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smarty!&rdquo; retorted Lena, poking out her tongue at him, and then, when he
      promptly did the same, crying at the top of her voice, &ldquo;Mother, Hans is
      making faces at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Hans; &ldquo;go on howling, and when you&rsquo;re in bed to-night
      I&rsquo;ll wait till you&rsquo;re asleep, and then I&rsquo;ll creep over and take a little
      tiny piece of your arm and twist and twist it until&mdash;&rdquo; He leant over
      the table making the most horrible faces at Lena, not noticing that Anton
      was standing behind his chair until the little boy bent over and spat on
      his brother&rsquo;s shaven head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, weh! oh, weh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Child-Who-Was-Tired pushed and pulled them apart, muffled them into
      their coats, and drove them out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry, hurry! the second bell&rsquo;s rung,&rdquo; she urged, knowing perfectly well
      she was telling a story, and rather exulting in the fact. She washed up
      the breakfast things, then went down to the cellar to look out the
      potatoes and beetroot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a funny, cold place the coal cellar! With potatoes banked on one
      corner, beetroot in an old candle box, two tubs of sauerkraut, and a
      twisted mass of dahlia roots&mdash;that looked as real as though they were
      fighting one another, thought the Child.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gathered the potatoes into her skirt, choosing big ones with few eyes
      because they were easier to peel, and bending over the dull heap in the
      silent cellar, she began to nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, you, what are you doing down there?&rdquo; cried the Frau, from the top
      of the stairs. &ldquo;The baby&rsquo;s fallen off the settle, and got a bump as big as
      an egg over his eye. Come up here, and I&rsquo;ll teach you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t me!&rdquo; screamed the Child, beaten from one
      side of the hall to the other, so that the potatoes and beetroot rolled
      out of her skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frau seemed to be as big as a giant, and there was a certain heaviness
      in all her movements that was terrifying to anyone so small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit in the corner, and peel and wash the vegetables, and keep the baby
      quiet while I do the washing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whimpering she obeyed, but as to keeping the baby quiet, that was
      impossible. His face was hot, little beads of sweat stood all over his
      head, and he stiffened his body and cried. She held him on her knees, with
      a pan of cold water beside her for the cleaned vegetables and the &ldquo;ducks&rsquo;
      bucket&rdquo; for the peelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ts&mdash;ts&mdash;ts!&rdquo; she crooned, scraping and boring; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s going
      to be another soon, and you can&rsquo;t both keep on crying. Why don&rsquo;t you go to
      sleep, baby? I would, if I were you. I&rsquo;ll tell you a dream. Once upon a
      time there was a little white road&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook back her head, a great lump ached in her throat and then the
      tears ran down her face on to the vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; said the Child, shaking them away. &ldquo;Just stop crying
      until I&rsquo;ve finished this, baby, and I&rsquo;ll walk you up and down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But by that time she had to peg out the washing for the Frau. A wind had
      sprung up. Standing on tiptoe in the yard, she almost felt she would be
      blown away. There was a bad smell coming from the ducks&rsquo; coop, which was
      half full of manure water, but away in the meadow she saw the grass
      blowing like little green hairs. And she remembered having heard of a
      child who had once played for a whole day in just such a meadow with real
      sausages and beer for her dinner&mdash;and not a little bit of tiredness.
      Who had told her that story? She could not remember, and yet it was so
      plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wet clothes flapped in her face as she pegged them; danced and jigged
      on the line, bulged out and twisted. She walked back to the house with
      lagging steps, looking longingly at the grass in the meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What must I do now, please?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make the beds and hang the baby&rsquo;s mattress out of the window, then get
      the wagon and take him for a little walk along the road. In front of the
      house, mind&mdash;where I can see you. Don&rsquo;t stand there, gaping! Then
      come in when I call you and help me cut up the salad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had made the beds the Child stood and looked at them. Gently she
      stroked the pillow with her hand, and then, just for one moment, let her
      head rest there. Again the smarting lump in her throat, the stupid tears
      that fell and kept on falling as she dressed the baby and dragged the
      little wagon up and down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man passed, driving a bullock wagon. He wore a long, queer feather in
      his hat, and whistled as he passed. Two girls with bundles on their
      shoulders came walking out of the village&mdash;one wore a red
      handkerchief about her head and one a blue. They were laughing and holding
      each other by the hand. Then the sun pushed by a heavy fold of grey cloud
      and spread a warm yellow light over everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; thought the Child-Who-Was-Tired, &ldquo;if I walked far enough up
      this road I might come to a little white one, with tall black trees on
      either side&mdash;a little road&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salad, salad!&rdquo; cried the Frau&rsquo;s voice from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the children came home from school, dinner was eaten, the Man took
      the Frau&rsquo;s share of pudding as well as his own, and the three children
      seemed to smear themselves all over with whatever they ate. Then more
      dish-washing and more cleaning and baby-minding. So the afternoon dragged
      coldly through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Frau Grathwohl came in with a fresh piece of pig&rsquo;s flesh for the Frau,
      and the Child listened to them gossiping together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frau Manda went on her &lsquo;journey to Rome&rsquo; last night, and brought back a
      daughter. How are you feeling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sick twice this morning,&rdquo; said the Frau. &ldquo;My insides are all
      twisted up with having children too quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve got a new help,&rdquo; commented old Mother Grathwohl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear Lord&rdquo;&mdash;the Frau lowered her voice&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know
      her? She&rsquo;s the free-born one&mdash;daughter of the waitress at the railway
      station. They found her mother trying to squeeze her head in the wash-hand
      jug, and the child&rsquo;s half silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ts&mdash;ts&mdash;ts!&rdquo; whispered the &ldquo;free-born&rdquo; one to the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day drew in the Child-Who-Was-Tired did not know how to fight her
      sleepiness any longer. She was afraid to sit down or stand still. As she
      sat at supper the Man and the Frau seemed to swell to an immense size as
      she watched them, and then become smaller than dolls, with little voices
      that seemed to come from outside the window. Looking at the baby, it
      suddenly had two heads, and then no head. Even his crying made her feel
      worse. When she thought of the nearness of bedtime she shook all over with
      excited joy. But as eight o&rsquo;clock approached there was the sound of wheels
      on the road, and presently in came a party of friends to spend the
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put on the coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me the sugar tin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry the chairs out of the bedroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, finally, the Frau sent her into the next room to keep the baby quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little piece of candle burning in the enamel bracket. As she
      walked up and down she saw her great big shadow on the wall like a
      grown-up person with a grown-up baby. Whatever would it look like when she
      carried two babies so!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ts&mdash;ts&mdash;ts! Once upon a time she was walking along a little
      white road, with oh! such great big black trees on either side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you!&rdquo; called the Frau&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;bring me my new jacket from behind
      the door.&rdquo; And as she took it into the warm room one of the women said,
      &ldquo;She looks like an owl. Such children are seldom right in their heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you keep that baby quiet?&rdquo; said the Man, who had just drunk
      enough beer to make him feel very brave and master of his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t keep that baby quiet you&rsquo;ll know why later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They burst out laughing as she stumbled back into the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Holy Mary could keep him quiet,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Did Jesus
      cry like this when He was little? If I was not so tired perhaps I could do
      it; but the baby just knows that I want to go to sleep. And there is going
      to be another one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung the baby on the bed, and stood looking at him with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the next room there came the jingle of glasses and the warm sound of
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she suddenly had a beautiful marvellous idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed for the first time that day, and clapped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ts&mdash;ts&mdash;ts!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;lie there, silly one;
      you <i>will</i> go to sleep. You&rsquo;ll not cry any more or wake up in the
      night. Funny, little, ugly baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened his eyes, and shrieked loudly at the sight of the
      Child-Who-Was-Tired. From the next room she heard the Frau call out to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment&mdash;he is almost asleep,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then gently, smiling, on tiptoe, she brought the pink bolster from the
      Frau&rsquo;s bed and covered the baby&rsquo;s face with it, pressed with all her might
      as he struggled, &ldquo;like a duck with its head off, wriggling&rdquo;, she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heaved a long sigh, then fell back on to the floor, and was walking
      along a little white road with tall black trees on either side, a little
      road that led to nowhere, and where nobody walked at all&mdash;nobody at
      all.

    <h2>
      11. THE ADVANCED LADY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think we might ask her to come with us,&rdquo; said Fräulein Elsa,
      retying her pink sash ribbon before my mirror. &ldquo;You know, although she is
      so intellectual, I cannot help feeling convinced that she has some secret
      sorrow. And Lisa told me this morning, as she was turning out my room,
      that she remains hours and hours by herself, writing; in fact Lisa says
      she is writing a book! I suppose that is why she never cares to mingle
      with us, and has so little time for her husband and the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>you</i> ask her,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I have never spoken to the lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elsa blushed faintly. &ldquo;I have only spoken to her once,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;I
      took her a bunch of wild flowers, to her room, and she came to the door in
      a white gown, with her hair loose. Never shall I forget that moment. She
      just took the flowers, and I heard her&mdash;because the door was not
      quite properly shut&mdash;I heard her, as I walked down the passage,
      saying &lsquo;Purity, fragrance, the fragrance of purity and the purity of
      fragrance!&rsquo; It was wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Frau Kellermann knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; she said, coming into the room and nodding to us very
      genially. &ldquo;The gentlemen are waiting on the steps, and I have asked the
      Advanced Lady to come with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, how extraordinary!&rdquo; cried Elsa. &ldquo;But this moment the
      gnädige Frau and I were debating whether&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I met her coming out of her room and she said she was charmed with
      the idea. Like all of us, she has never been to Schlingen. She is
      downstairs now, talking to Herr Erchardt. I think we shall have a
      delightful afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Fritzi waiting too?&rdquo; asked Elsa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he is, dear child&mdash;as impatient as a hungry man listening
      for the dinner bell. Run along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elsa ran, and Frau Kellermann smiled at me significantly. In the past she
      and I had seldom spoken to each other, owing to the fact that her &ldquo;one
      remaining joy&rdquo;&mdash;her charming little Karl&mdash;had never succeeded in
      kindling into flame those sparks of maternity which are supposed to glow
      in great numbers upon the altar of every respectable female heart; but, in
      view of a premeditated journey together, we became delightfully cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For us,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there will be a double joy. We shall be able to watch
      the happiness of these two dear children, Elsa and Fritz. They only
      received the letters of blessing from their parents yesterday morning. It
      is a very strange thing, but whenever I am in the company of newly-engaged
      couples I blossom. Newly-engaged couples, mothers with first babies, and
      normal deathbeds have precisely the same effect on me. Shall we join the
      others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was longing to ask her why normal deathbeds should cause anyone to burst
      into flower, and said, &ldquo;Yes, do let us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were greeted by the little party of &ldquo;cure guests&rdquo; on the pension steps,
      with those cries of joy and excitement which herald so pleasantly the
      mildest German excursion. Herr Erchardt and I had not met before that day,
      so, in accordance with strict pension custom, we asked each other how long
      we had slept during the night, had we dreamed agreeably, what time we had
      got up, was the coffee fresh when we had appeared at breakfast, and how
      had we passed the morning. Having toiled up these stairs of almost
      national politeness we landed, triumphant and smiling, and paused to
      recover breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Herr Erchardt, &ldquo;I have a pleasure in store for you. The
      Frau Professor is going to be one of us for the afternoon. Yes,&rdquo; nodding
      graciously to the Advanced Lady. &ldquo;Allow me to introduce you to each
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We bowed very formally, and looked each other over with that eye which is
      known as &ldquo;eagle&rdquo; but is far more the property of the female than that most
      unoffending of birds. &ldquo;I think you are English?&rdquo; she said. I acknowledged
      the fact. &ldquo;I am reading a great many English books just now&mdash;rather,
      I am studying them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nu,&rdquo; cried Herr Erchardt. &ldquo;Fancy that! What a bond already! I have made
      up my mind to know Shakespeare in his mother tongue before I die, but that
      you, Frau Professor, should be already immersed in those wells of English
      thought!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what I have read,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I do not think they are very deep
      wells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;so I have heard.... But do not let us
      embitter our excursion for our little English friend. We will speak of this
      another time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nu, are we ready?&rdquo; cried Fritz, who stood, supporting Elsa&rsquo;s elbow in his
      hand, at the foot of the steps. It was immediately discovered that Karl
      was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ka&mdash;rl, Karl&mdash;chen!&rdquo; we cried. No response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he was here one moment ago,&rdquo; said Herr Langen, a tired, pale youth,
      who was recovering from a nervous breakdown due to much philosophy and
      little nourishment. &ldquo;He was sitting here, picking out the works of his
      watch with a hairpin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frau Kellermann rounded on him. &ldquo;Do you mean to say, my dear Herr Langen,
      you did not stop the child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Herr Langen; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried stopping him before now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Da, that child has such energy; never is his brain at peace. If he is not
      doing one thing, he is doing another!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he has started on the dining-room clock now,&rdquo; suggested Herr
      Langen, abominably hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Advanced Lady suggested that we should go without him. &ldquo;I never take
      my little daughter for walks,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have accustomed her to sitting
      quietly in my bedroom from the time I go out until I return!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is&mdash;there he is,&rdquo; piped Elsa, and Karl was observed
      slithering down a chestnut-tree, very much the worse for twigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been listening to what you said about me, mumma,&rdquo; he confessed while
      Frau Kellermann brushed him down. &ldquo;It was not true about the watch. I was
      only looking at it, and the little girl never stays in the bedroom. She
      told me herself she always goes down to the kitchen, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Da, that&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; said Frau Kellermann.
    </p>
    <p>
      We marched <i>en masse</i> along the station road. It was a very warm afternoon,
      and continuous parties of &ldquo;cure guests&rdquo;, who were giving their digestions
      a quiet airing in pension gardens, called after us, asked if we were going
      for a walk, and cried &ldquo;Herr Gott&mdash;happy journey&rdquo; with immense
      ill-concealed relish when we mentioned Schlingen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is eight kilometres,&rdquo; shouted one old man with a white beard,
      who leaned against a fence, fanning himself with a yellow handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven and a half,&rdquo; answered Herr Erchardt shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight,&rdquo; bellowed the sage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven and a half!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is mad,&rdquo; said Herr Erchardt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, please let him be mad in peace,&rdquo; said I, putting my hands over my
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such ignorance must not be allowed to go uncontradicted,&rdquo; said he, and
      turning his back on us, too exhausted to cry out any longer, he held up
      seven and a half fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight!&rdquo; thundered the greybeard, with pristine freshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      We felt very sobered, and did not recover until we reached a white
      signpost which entreated us to leave the road and walk through the field
      path&mdash;without trampling down more of the grass than was necessary.
      Being interpreted, it meant &ldquo;single file&rdquo;, which was distressing for Elsa
      and Fritz. Karl, like a happy child, gambolled ahead, and cut down as many
      flowers as possible with the stick of his mother&rsquo;s parasol&mdash;followed
      the three others&mdash;then myself&mdash;and the lovers in the rear. And
      above the conversation of the advance party I had the privilege of hearing
      these delicious whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fritz: &ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo; Elsa: &ldquo;Nu&mdash;yes.&rdquo; Fritz
      passionately: &ldquo;But how much?&rdquo; To which Elsa never replied&mdash;except
      with &ldquo;How much do <i>you</i> love <i>me?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fritz escaped that truly Christian trap by saying, &ldquo;I asked you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It grew so confusing that I slipped in front of Frau Kellermann&mdash;and
      walked in the peaceful knowledge that she was blossoming and I was under
      no obligation to inform even my nearest and dearest as to the precise
      capacity of my affections. &ldquo;What right have they to ask each other such
      questions the day after letters of blessing have been received?&rdquo; I
      reflected. &ldquo;What right have they even to question each other? Love which
      becomes engaged and married is a purely affirmative affair&mdash;they are
      usurping the privileges of their betters and wisers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The edges of the field frilled over into an immense pine forest&mdash;very
      pleasant and cool it looked. Another signpost begged us to keep to the
      broad path for Schlingen and deposit waste paper and fruit peelings in
      wire receptacles attached to the benches for the purpose. We sat down on
      the first bench, and Karl with great curiosity explored the wire
      receptacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love woods,&rdquo; said the Advanced Lady, smiling pitifully into the air.
      &ldquo;In a wood my hair already seems to stir and remember something of its
      savage origin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But speaking literally,&rdquo; said Frau Kellermann, after an appreciative
      pause, &ldquo;there is really nothing better than the air of pine-trees for the
      scalp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Frau Kellermann, please don&rsquo;t break the spell,&rdquo; said Elsa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Advanced Lady looked at her very sympathetically. &ldquo;Have you, too,
      found the magic heart of Nature?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was Herr Langen&rsquo;s cue. &ldquo;Nature has no heart,&rdquo; said he, very bitterly
      and readily, as people do who are over-philosophised and underfed. &ldquo;She
      creates that she may destroy. She eats that she may spew up and she spews
      up that she may eat. That is why we, who are forced to eke out an
      existence at her trampling feet, consider the world mad, and realise the
      deadly vulgarity of production.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; interrupted Herr Erchardt, &ldquo;you have never lived and you have
      never suffered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, excuse me&mdash;how can you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know because you have told me, and there&rsquo;s an end of it. Come back to
      this bench in ten years&rsquo; time and repeat those words to me,&rdquo; said Frau
      Kellermann, with an eye upon Fritz, who was engaged in counting Elsa&rsquo;s
      fingers with passionate fervour&mdash;&ldquo;and bring with you your young wife,
      Herr Langen, and watch, perhaps, your little child playing with&mdash;&rdquo;
       She turned towards Karl, who had rooted an old illustrated paper out of
      the receptacle and was spelling over an advertisement for the enlargement
      of Beautiful Breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentence remained unfinished. We decided to move on. As we plunged
      more deeply into the wood our spirits rose&mdash;reaching a point where
      they burst into song&mdash;on the part of the three men&mdash;&ldquo;O Welt, wie
      bist du wunderbar!&rdquo;&mdash;the lower part of which was piercingly sustained
      by Herr Langen, who attempted quite unsuccessfully to infuse satire into
      it in accordance with his&mdash;&ldquo;world outlook&rdquo;. They strode ahead and
      left us to trail after them&mdash;hot and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now is the opportunity,&rdquo; said Frau Kellermann. &ldquo;Dear Frau Professor, do
      tell us a little about your book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach, how did you know I was writing one?&rdquo; she cried playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elsa, here, had it from Lisa. And never before have I personally known a
      woman who was writing a book. How do you manage to find enough to write
      down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is never the trouble,&rdquo; said the Advanced Lady&mdash;she took Elsa&rsquo;s
      arm and leaned on it gently. &ldquo;The trouble is to know where to stop. My
      brain has been a hive for years, and about three months ago the pent-up
      waters burst over my soul, and since then I am writing all day until late
      into the night, still ever finding fresh inspirations and thoughts which
      beat impatient wings about my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a novel?&rdquo; asked Elsa shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is a novel,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you be so positive?&rdquo; said Frau Kellermann, eyeing me severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because nothing but a novel could produce an effect like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach, don&rsquo;t quarrel,&rdquo; said the Advanced Lady sweetly. &ldquo;Yes, it is a novel&mdash;upon
      the Modern Woman. For this seems to me the woman&rsquo;s hour. It is mysterious
      and almost prophetic, it is the symbol of the true advanced woman: not one
      of those violent creatures who deny their sex and smother their frail
      wings under... under&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The English tailor-made?&rdquo; from Frau Kellermann.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not going to put it like that. Rather, under the lying garb of
      false masculinity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a subtle distinction!&rdquo; I murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom then,&rdquo; asked Fräulein Elsa, looking adoringly at the Advanced Lady&mdash;&ldquo;whom
      then do you consider the true woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the incarnation of comprehending Love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my dear Frau Professor,&rdquo; protested Frau Kellermann, &ldquo;you must
      remember that one has so few opportunities for exhibiting Love within the
      family circle nowadays. One&rsquo;s husband is at business all day, and
      naturally desires to sleep when he returns home&mdash;one&rsquo;s children are
      out of the lap and in at the university before one can lavish anything at
      all upon them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Love is not a question of lavishing,&rdquo; said the Advanced Lady. &ldquo;It is
      the lamp carried in the bosom touching with serene rays all the heights
      and depths of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darkest Africa,&rdquo; I murmured flippantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mistake we have made in the past&mdash;as a sex,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;is in
      not realising that our gifts of giving are for the whole world&mdash;we
      are the glad sacrifice of ourselves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Elsa rapturously, and almost bursting into gifts as she
      breathed&mdash;&ldquo;how I know that! You know ever since Fritz and I have been
      engaged, I share the desire to give to everybody, to share everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How extremely dangerous,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only the beauty of danger, or the danger of beauty&rdquo; said the
      Advanced Lady&mdash;&ldquo;and there you have the ideal of my book&mdash;that
      woman is nothing but a gift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled at her very sweetly. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I, too, would like
      to write a book, on the advisability of caring for daughters, and taking
      them for airings and keeping them out of kitchens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I think the masculine element must have felt these angry vibrations: they
      ceased from singing, and together we climbed out of the wood, to see
      Schlingen below us, tucked in a circle of hills, the white houses shining
      in the sunlight, &ldquo;for all the world like eggs in a bird&rsquo;s nest&rdquo;, as Herr
      Erchardt declared. We descended upon Schlingen and demanded sour milk with
      fresh cream and bread at the Inn of the Golden Stag, a most friendly
      place, with tables in a rose-garden where hens and chickens ran riot&mdash;even
      flopping upon the disused tables and pecking at the red checks on the
      cloths. We broke the bread into the bowls, added the cream, and stirred it
      round with flat wooden spoons, the landlord and his wife standing by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid weather!&rdquo; said Herr Erchardt, waving his spoon at the landlord,
      who shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you don&rsquo;t call it splendid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said the landlord, obviously scorning us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a beautiful walk,&rdquo; said Fräulein Elsa, making a free gift of her
      most charming smile to the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never walk,&rdquo; said the landlady; &ldquo;when I go to Mindelbau my man drives
      me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve more important things to do with my legs than walk them
      through the dust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like these people,&rdquo; confessed Herr Langen to me. &ldquo;I like them very,
      very much. I think I shall take a room here for the whole summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because they live close to the earth, and therefore despise it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed away his bowl of sour milk and lit a cigarette. We ate, solidly
      and seriously, until those seven and a half kilometres to Mindelbau
      stretched before us like an eternity. Even Karl&rsquo;s activity became so full
      fed that he lay on the ground and removed his leather waistbelt. Elsa
      suddenly leaned over to Fritz and whispered, who on hearing her to the end
      and asking her if she loved him, got up and made a little speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&mdash;we wish to celebrate our betrothal by&mdash;by&mdash;asking you
      all to drive back with us in the landlord&rsquo;s cart&mdash;if&mdash;it will
      hold us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a beautiful, noble idea!&rdquo; said Frau Kellermann, heaving a sigh
      of relief that audibly burst two hooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my little gift,&rdquo; said Elsa to the Advanced Lady, who by virtue of
      three portions almost wept tears of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squeezed into the peasant cart and driven by the landlord, who showed his
      contempt for mother earth by spitting savagely every now and again, we
      jolted home again, and the nearer we came to Mindelbau the more we loved
      it and one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have many excursions like this,&rdquo; said Herr Erchardt to me, &ldquo;for
      one surely gets to know a person in the simple surroundings of the open
      air&mdash;one <i>shares</i> the same joys&mdash;one feels friendship. What is it
      your Shakespeare says? One moment, I have it. The friends thou hast, and
      their adoption tried&mdash;grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, feeling very friendly towards him, &ldquo;the bother about my
      soul is that it refuses to grapple anybody at all&mdash;and I am sure that
      the dead weight of a friend whose adoption it had tried would kill it
      immediately. Never yet has it shown the slightest sign of a hoop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bumped against my knees and excused himself and the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear little lady, you must not take the quotation literally.
      Naturally, one is not physically conscious of the hoops; but hoops there
      are in the soul of him or her who loves his fellow-men.... Take this
      afternoon, for instance. How did we start out? As strangers you might
      almost say, and yet&mdash;all of us&mdash;how have we come home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a cart,&rdquo; said the only remaining joy, who sat upon his mother&rsquo;s lap
      and felt sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      We skirted the field that we had passed through, going round by the
      cemetery. Herr Langen leaned over the edge of the seat and greeted the
      graves. He was sitting next to the Advanced Lady&mdash;inside the shelter
      of her shoulder. I heard her murmur: &ldquo;You look like a little boy with your
      hair blowing about in the wind.&rdquo; Herr Langen, slightly less bitter&mdash;watched
      the last graves disappear. And I heard her murmur: &ldquo;Why are you so sad? I
      too am very sad sometimes&mdash;but&mdash;you look young enough for me to
      dare to say this&mdash;I&mdash;too&mdash;know of much joy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leaned over and touched the Advanced Lady&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it been a nice
      afternoon?&rdquo; I said questioningly. &ldquo;But you know, that theory of yours
      about women and Love&mdash;it&rsquo;s as old as the hills&mdash;oh, older!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the road a sudden shout of triumph. Yes, there he was again&mdash;white
      beard, silk handkerchief and undaunted enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I say? Eight kilometres&mdash;it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven and a half!&rdquo; shrieked Herr Erchardt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, do you return in carts? Eight kilometres it must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herr Erchardt made a cup of his hands and stood up in the jolting cart
      while Frau Kellermann clung to his knees. &ldquo;Seven and a half!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ignorance must not go uncontradicted!&rdquo; I said to the Advanced Lady.

      12. THE SWING OF THE PENDULUM
    </h2>
    <p>
      The landlady knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Viola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a letter for you,&rdquo; said the landlady, &ldquo;a special letter&rdquo;&mdash;she
      held the green envelope in a corner of her dingy apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Viola, kneeling on the floor, poking at the little dusty stove,
      stretched out her hand. &ldquo;Any answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the messenger has gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right!&rdquo; She did not look the landlady in the face; she was
      ashamed of not having paid her rent, and wondered grimly, without any
      hope, if the woman would begin to bluster again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About this money owing to me&mdash;&rdquo; said the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Lord&mdash;off she goes!&rdquo; thought Viola, turning her back on the
      woman and making a grimace at the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s settle&mdash;or it&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; The landlady raised her voice; she began
      to bawl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a landlady, I am, and a respectable woman, I&rsquo;ll have you
      know. I&rsquo;ll have no lice in my house, sneaking their way into the furniture
      and eating up everything. It&rsquo;s cash&mdash;or out you go before twelve
      o&rsquo;clock to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viola felt rather than saw the woman&rsquo;s gesture. She shot out her arm in a
      stupid helpless way, as though a dirty pigeon had suddenly flown at her
      face. &ldquo;Filthy old beast! Ugh! And the smell of her&mdash;like stale cheese
      and damp washing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; she answered shortly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s cash down or I leave to-morrow.
      All right: don&rsquo;t shout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was extraordinary&mdash;always before this woman came near her she
      trembled in her shoes&mdash;even the sound of those flat feet stumping up
      the stairs made her feel sick, but once they were face to face she felt
      immensely calm and indifferent, and could not understand why she even
      worried about money, nor why she sneaked out of the house on tiptoe, not
      even daring to shut the door after her in case the landlady should hear
      and shout something terrible, nor why she spent nights pacing up and down
      her room&mdash;drawing up sharply before the mirror and saying to a tragic
      reflection: &ldquo;Money, money, money!&rdquo; When she was alone her poverty was like
      a huge dream-mountain on which her feet were fast rooted&mdash;aching with
      the ache of the size of the thing&mdash;but if it came to definite action,
      with no time for imaginings, her dream-mountain dwindled into a beastly
      &ldquo;hold-your-nose&rdquo; affair, to be passed as quickly as possible, with anger
      and a strong sense of superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady bounced out of the room, banging the door, so that it shook
      and rattled as though it had listened to the conversation and fully
      sympathised with the old hag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squatting on her heels, Viola opened the letter. It was from Casimir:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be with you at three o&rsquo;clock this afternoon&mdash;and must be off
      again this evening. All news when we meet. I hope you are happier than I.&mdash;CASIMIR.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! how kind!&rdquo; she sneered; &ldquo;how condescending. Too good
      of you, really!&rdquo; She sprang to her feet, crumbling the letter in her
      hands. &ldquo;And how are you to know that I shall stick here awaiting your
      pleasure until three o&rsquo;clock this afternoon?&rdquo; But she knew she would;
      her rage was only half sincere. She longed to see Casimir, for she was confident
      that this time she would make him understand the situation.... &ldquo;For, as
      it is, it&rsquo;s intolerable&mdash;intolerable!&rdquo; she muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning of a grey day curiously lighted by pale
      flashes of sunshine. Searched by these flashes her room looked tumbled and
      grimed. She pulled down the window-blinds&mdash;but they gave a
      persistent, whitish glare which was just as bad. The only thing of life in
      the room was a jar of hyacinths given her by the landlady&rsquo;s daughter: it
      stood on the table exuding a sickly perfume from its plump petals; there
      were even rich buds unfolding, and the leaves shone like oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viola went over to the washstand, poured some water into the enamel basin,
      and sponged her face and neck. She dipped her face into the water, opened
      her eyes, and shook her head from side to side&mdash;it was exhilarating.
      She did it three times. &ldquo;I suppose I could drown myself if I stayed under
      long enough,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I wonder how long it takes to become
      unconscious?... Often read of women drowning in a bucket. I wonder if any
      air enters by the ears&mdash;if the basin would have to be as deep as a
      bucket?&rdquo; She experimented&mdash;gripped the washstand with both hands and
      slowly sank her head into the water, when again there was a knock on the
      door. Not the landlady this time&mdash;it must be Casimir. With her face
      and hair dripping, with her petticoat bodice unbuttoned, she ran and
      opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange man stood against the lintel&mdash;seeing her, he opened his
      eyes very wide and smiled delightfully. &ldquo;Excuse me&mdash;does Fräulein
      Schäfer live here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; never heard of her.&rdquo; His smile was so infectious, she wanted to smile
      too&mdash;and the water had made her feel so fresh and rosy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange man appeared overwhelmed with astonishment. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;She is out, you mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s not living here,&rdquo; answered Viola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;pardon&mdash;one moment.&rdquo; He moved from the door lintel,
      standing squarely in front of her. He unbuttoned his greatcoat and drew a
      slip of paper from the breast pocket, smoothing it in his gloved fingers
      before handing it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the address, right enough, but there must be a mistake in the
      number. So many lodging-houses in this street, you know, and so big.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drops of water fell from her hair on to the paper. She burst out laughing.
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>how</i> dreadful I must look&mdash;one moment!&rdquo; She ran back
      to the washstand and caught up a towel. The door was still open.... After all,
      there was nothing more to be said. Why on earth had she asked him to wait
      a moment? She folded the towel round her shoulders, and returned to the
      door, suddenly grave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry; I know no such name&rdquo; in a sharp voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the strange man: &ldquo;Sorry, too. Have you been living here long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;yes&mdash;a long time.&rdquo; She began to close the door slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;good-morning, thanks so much. Hope I haven&rsquo;t been a bother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard him walk down the passage and then pause&mdash;lighting a
      cigarette. Yes&mdash;a faint scent of delicious cigarette smoke penetrated
      her room. She sniffed at it, smiling again. Well, that had been a
      fascinating interlude! He looked so amazingly happy: his heavy clothes and
      big buttoned gloves; his beautifully brushed hair... and that smile...
      &ldquo;Jolly&rdquo; was the word&mdash;just a well-fed boy with the world for his
      playground. People like that did one good&mdash;one felt &ldquo;made over&rdquo; at
      the sight of them. <i>Sane</i> they were&mdash;so sane and solid. You could
      depend on them never having one mad impulse from the day they were born
      until the day they died. And Life was in league with them&mdash;jumped
      them on her knee&mdash;quite rightly, too. At that moment she noticed
      Casimir&rsquo;s letter, crumpled up on the floor&mdash;the smile faded. Staring
      at the letter she began braiding her hair&mdash;a dull feeling of rage
      crept through her&mdash;she seemed to be braiding it into her brain, and
      binding it, tightly, above her head.... Of course that had been the mistake
      all along. What had? Oh, Casimir&rsquo;s frightful seriousness. If she had been
      happy when they first met she never would have looked at him&mdash;but
      they had been like two patients in the same hospital ward&mdash;each
      finding comfort in the sickness of the other&mdash;sweet foundation for a
      love episode! Misfortune had knocked their heads together: they had looked
      at each other, stunned with the conflict and sympathised... &ldquo;I wish I
      could step outside the whole affair and just judge it&mdash;then I&rsquo;d find
      a way out. I certainly was in love with Casimir.... Oh, be sincere for
      once.&rdquo; She flopped down on the bed and hid her face in the pillow. &ldquo;I was
      not in love. I wanted somebody to look after me&mdash;and keep me until my
      work began to sell&mdash;and he kept bothers with other men away. And what
      would have happened if he hadn&rsquo;t come along? I would have spent my
      wretched little pittance, and then&mdash;Yes, that was what decided me,
      thinking about that &lsquo;then.&rsquo; He was the only solution. And I believed in
      him then. I thought his work had only to be recognised once, and he&rsquo;d roll
      in wealth. I thought perhaps we might be poor for a month&mdash;but he
      said, if only he could have me, the stimulus.... Funny, if it wasn&rsquo;t so
      damned tragic! Exactly the contrary has happened&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t had a
      thing published for months&mdash;neither have I&mdash;but then I didn&rsquo;t
      expect to. Yes, the truth is, I&rsquo;m hard and bitter, and I have neither
      faith nor love for unsuccessful men. I always end by despising them as I
      despise Casimir. I suppose it&rsquo;s the savage pride of the female who likes
      to think the man to whom she has given herself must be a very great chief
      indeed. But to stew in this disgusting house while Casimir scours the land
      in the hope of finding one editorial open door&mdash;it&rsquo;s humiliating.
      It&rsquo;s changed my whole nature. I wasn&rsquo;t born for poverty&mdash;I only
      flower among really jolly people, and people who never are worried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The figure of the strange man rose before her&mdash;would not be
      dismissed. &ldquo;That was the man for me, after all is said and done&mdash;a
      man without a care&mdash;who&rsquo;d give me everything I want and with whom I&rsquo;d
      always feel that sense of life and of being in touch with the world. I
      never wanted to fight&mdash;it was thrust on me. Really, there&rsquo;s a fount
      of happiness in me, that is drying up, little by little, in this hateful
      existence. I&rsquo;ll be dead if this goes on&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;she stirred in
      the bed and flung out her arms&mdash;&ldquo;I want passion, and love, and
      adventure&mdash;I yearn for them. Why should I stay here and rot?&mdash;I
      am rotting!&rdquo; she cried, comforting herself with the sound of her breaking
      voice. &ldquo;But if I tell Casimir all this when he comes this afternoon, and
      he says, &lsquo;Go&rsquo;&mdash;as he certainly will&mdash;that&rsquo;s another thing I
      loathe about him&mdash;he&rsquo;s under my thumb&mdash;what should I do then&mdash;where
      should I go to?&rdquo; There was nowhere. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to work&mdash;or carve
      out my own path. I want ease and any amount of nursing in the lap of
      luxury. There is only one thing I&rsquo;m fitted for, and that is to be a great
      courtesan.&rdquo; But she did not know how to go about it. She was frightened to
      go into the streets&mdash;she heard of such awful things happening to
      those women&mdash;men with diseases&mdash;or men who didn&rsquo;t pay&mdash;besides,
      the idea of a strange man every night&mdash;no, that was out of the
      question. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d the clothes I would go to a really good hotel and find
      some wealthy man... like the strange man this morning. He would be ideal.
      Oh, if I only had his address&mdash;I am sure I would fascinate him. I&rsquo;d
      keep him laughing all day&mdash;I&rsquo;d make him give me unlimited money....&rdquo;
       At the thought she grew warm and soft. She began to dream of a wonderful
      house, and of presses full of clothes and of perfumes. She saw herself
      stepping into carriages&mdash;looking at the strange man with a
      mysterious, voluptuous glance&mdash;she practised the glance, lying on the
      bed&mdash;and never another worry, just drugged with happiness. That was
      the life for her. Well, the thing to do was to let Casimir go on his
      wild-goose chase that evening, and while he was away&mdash;What! Also&mdash;please
      to remember&mdash;there was the rent to be paid before twelve next
      morning, and she hadn&rsquo;t the money for a square meal. At the thought of
      food she felt a sharp twinge in her stomach, a sensation as though there
      were a hand in her stomach, squeezing it dry. She was terribly hungry&mdash;all
      Casimir&rsquo;s fault&mdash;and that man had lived on the fat of the land ever
      since he was born. He looked as though he could order a magnificent
      dinner. Oh, why hadn&rsquo;t she played her cards better?&mdash;he&rsquo;d been sent
      by Providence&mdash;and she&rsquo;d snubbed him. &ldquo;If I had that time over again,
      I&rsquo;d be safe by now.&rdquo; And instead of the ordinary man who had spoken with
      her at the door her mind created a brilliant, laughing image, who would
      treat her like a queen.... &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing I could not stand&mdash;that
      he should be coarse or vulgar. Well, he wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;he was obviously a
      man of the world, and the way he apologised... I have enough faith in my
      own power and beauty to know I could make a man treat me just as I wanted
      to be treated.&rdquo;... It floated into her dreams&mdash;that sweet scent of
      cigarette smoke. And then she remembered that she had heard nobody go down
      the stone stairs. Was it possible that the strange man was still there?...
      The thought was too absurd&mdash;Life didn&rsquo;t play tricks like that&mdash;and
      yet&mdash;she was quite conscious of his nearness. Very quietly she got
      up, unhooked from the back of the door a long white gown, buttoned it on&mdash;smiling
      slyly. She did not know what was going to happen. She only thought: &ldquo;Oh,
      what fun!&rdquo; and that they were playing a delicious game&mdash;this strange
      man and she. Very gently she turned the door-handle, screwing up her face
      and biting her lip as the lock snapped back. Of course, there he was&mdash;leaning
      against the banister rail. He wheeled round as she slipped into the
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Da,&rdquo; she muttered, folding her gown tightly around her, &ldquo;I must go
      downstairs and fetch some wood. Brr! the cold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any wood,&rdquo; volunteered the strange man. She gave a little cry
      of astonishment, and then tossed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You again,&rdquo; she said scornfully, conscious the while of his merry eye,
      and the fresh, strong smell of his healthy body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The landlady shouted out there was no wood left. I just saw her go out to
      buy some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Story&mdash;story!&rdquo; she longed to cry. He came quite close to her, stood
      over her and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to ask me to finish my cigarette in your room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;You may if you want to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that moment together in the passage a miracle had happened. Her room
      was quite changed&mdash;it was full of sweet light and the scent of
      hyacinth flowers. Even the furniture appeared different&mdash;exciting.
      Quick as a flash she remembered childish parties when they had played
      charades, and one side had left the room and come in again to act a word&mdash;just
      what she was doing now. The strange man went over to the stove and sat
      down in her arm-chair. She did not want him to talk or come near her&mdash;it
      was enough to see him in the room, so secure and happy. How hungry she had
      been for the nearness of someone like that&mdash;who knew nothing at all
      about her&mdash;and made no demands&mdash;but just lived. Viola ran over
      to the table and put her arms round the jar of hyacinths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful! Beautiful!&rdquo; she cried&mdash;burying her head in the flowers&mdash;and
      sniffing greedily at the scent. Over the leaves she looked at the man and
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a funny little thing,&rdquo; said he lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because I love flowers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d far rather you loved other things,&rdquo; said the strange man slowly. She
      broke off a little pink petal and smiled at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me send you some flowers,&rdquo; said the strange man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you a
      roomful if you&rsquo;d like them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice frightened her slightly. &ldquo;Oh no, thanks&mdash;this one is quite
      enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;in a teasing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a stupid remark!&rdquo; thought Viola, and looking at him again he did not
      seem quite so jolly. She noticed that his eyes were set too closely
      together&mdash;and they were too small. Horrible thought, that he should
      prove stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do all day?&rdquo; she asked hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I do anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t imagine for one moment that I condemn such
      wisdom&mdash;only it sounds too good to be true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;&mdash;he craned forward. &ldquo;What sounds too
      good to be true?&rdquo; Yes&mdash;there was no denying it&mdash;he looked silly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the searching after Fräulein Schäfer doesn&rsquo;t occupy all your
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled broadly&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s very good!
      By Jove! no. I drive a good bit&mdash;are you keen on horses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Love them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come driving with me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a fine pair of
      greys. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty I&rsquo;d look perched behind greys in my one and only hat,&rdquo; thought
      she. Aloud: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo; Her easy acceptance pleased him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about to-morrow?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Suppose you have lunch
      with me to-morrow and I take you driving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After all&mdash;this was just a game. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m not busy to-morrow,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little pause&mdash;then the strange man patted his leg. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
      come and sit down?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pretended not to see and swung on to the table. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not&rdquo;&mdash;again the teasing voice. &ldquo;Come and sit on my knee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Viola very heartily, suddenly busy with her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come along&rdquo;&mdash;impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head from side to side. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dream of such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that he got up and came over to her. &ldquo;Funny little puss cat!&rdquo; He put up
      one hand to touch her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and slipped off the table. &ldquo;I&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s
      time you went now.&rdquo; She was quite frightened now&mdash;thinking only:
      &ldquo;This man must be got rid of as quickly as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you don&rsquo;t want me to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do&mdash;I&rsquo;m very busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Busy. What does the pussy cat do all day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots and lots of things!&rdquo; She wanted to push him out of the room and slam
      the door on him&mdash;idiot&mdash;fool&mdash;cruel disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s she frowning for?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Is she worried about anything?&rdquo;
       Suddenly serious: &ldquo;I say&mdash;you know, are you in any financial
      difficulty? Do you want money? I&rsquo;ll give it to you if you like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money! Steady on the brake&mdash;don&rsquo;t lose your head!&rdquo;&mdash;so she
      spoke to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you two hundred marks if you&rsquo;ll kiss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, boo! What a condition! And I don&rsquo;t want to kiss you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      like kissing. Please go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you do!&mdash;yes, you do.&rdquo; He caught hold of her arms above
      the elbows. She struggled, and was quite amazed to realise how angry she
      felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go&mdash;immediately!&rdquo; she cried&mdash;and he slipped one arm
      round her body, and drew her towards him&mdash;like a bar of iron across
      her back&mdash;that arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me alone! I tell you. Don&rsquo;t be mean! I didn&rsquo;t want this to happen
      when you came into my room. How dare you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, kiss me and I&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was too idiotic&mdash;dodging that stupid, smiling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t kiss you!&mdash;you brute!&mdash;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Somehow she slipped
      out of his arms and ran to the wall&mdash;stood back against it&mdash;breathing
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;Go on now, clear out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, when he was not touching her, she quite enjoyed herself.
      She thrilled at her own angry voice. &ldquo;To think I should talk to a man like
      that!&rdquo; An angry flush spread over his face&mdash;his lips curled back,
      showing his teeth&mdash;just like a dog, thought Viola. He made a rush at
      her, and held her against the wall&mdash;pressed upon her with all the
      weight of his body. This time she could not get free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t kiss you. I won&rsquo;t. Stop doing that Ugh! you&rsquo;re like a dog&mdash;you
      ought to find lovers round lamp-posts&mdash;you beast&mdash;you fiend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer. With an expression of the most absurd determination he
      pressed ever more heavily upon her. He did not even look at her&mdash;but
      rapped out in a sharp voice: &ldquo;Keep quiet&mdash;keep quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gar&mdash;r! Why are men so strong?&rdquo; She began to cry. &ldquo;Go away&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t want you, you dirty creature. I want to murder you. Oh, my God! if I
      had a knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly&mdash;come and be good!&rdquo; He dragged her towards the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose I&rsquo;m a light woman?&rdquo; she snarled, and swooping over she
      fastened her teeth in his glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach! don&rsquo;t do that&mdash;you are hurting me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not let go, but her heart said, &ldquo;Thank the Lord I thought of
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop this minute&mdash;you vixen&mdash;you bitch.&rdquo; He threw her away from
      him. She saw with joy that his eyes were full of tears. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve really
      hurt me,&rdquo; he said in a choking voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I have. I meant to. That&rsquo;s nothing to what I&rsquo;ll do if you touch
      me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strange man picked up his hat. &ldquo;No thanks,&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll
      not forget this&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go to your landlady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders and laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her you forced
      your way in here and tried to assault me. Who will she believe?&mdash;with
      your bitten hand. You go and find your Schäfers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sensation of glorious, intoxicating happiness flooded Viola. She rolled
      her eyes at him. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go away this moment I&rsquo;ll bite you again,&rdquo;
       she said, and the absurd words started her laughing. Even when the door
      was closed, hearing him descending the stairs, she laughed, and danced
      about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a morning! Oh, chalk it up. That was her first fight, and she&rsquo;d won&mdash;she&rsquo;d
      conquered that beast&mdash;all by herself. Her hands were still trembling.
      She pulled up the sleeve of her gown&mdash;great red marks on her arms.
      &ldquo;My ribs will be blue. I&rsquo;ll be blue all over,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;If only
      that beloved Casimir could have seen us.&rdquo; And the feeling of rage and
      disgust against Casimir had totally disappeared. How could the poor
      darling help not having any money? It was her fault as much as his, and
      he, just like her, was apart from the world, fighting it, just as she had
      done. If only three o&rsquo;clock would come. She saw herself running towards
      him and putting her arms round his neck. &ldquo;My blessed one! Of course we are
      bound to win. Do you love me still? Oh, I have been horrible lately.&rdquo;

      13. A BLAZE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Max, you silly devil, you&rsquo;ll break your neck if you go careering
      down the slide that way. Drop it, and come to the Club House with me and
      get some coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough for to-day. I&rsquo;m damp all through. There, give us a
      cigarette, Victor, old man. When are you going home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for another hour. It&rsquo;s fine this afternoon, and I&rsquo;m getting into
      decent shape. Look out, get off the track; here comes Fräulein Winkel.
      Damned elegant the way she manages her sleigh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold all through. That&rsquo;s the worst of this place&mdash;the mists&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      a damp cold. Here, Forman, look after this sleigh&mdash;and stick it
      somewhere so that I can get it without looking through a hundred and fifty
      others to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat down at a small round table near the stove and ordered coffee.
      Victor sprawled in his chair, patting his little brown dog Bobo and
      looking, half laughingly, at Max.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my dear? Isn&rsquo;t the world being nice and pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want my coffee, and I want to put my feet into my pocket&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      like stones.... Nothing to eat, thanks&mdash;the cake is like underdone
      india-rubber here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fuchs and Wistuba came and sat at their table. Max half turned his back
      and stretched his feet out to the oven. The three other men all began
      talking at once&mdash;of the weather&mdash;of the record slide&mdash;of
      the fine condition of the Wald See for skating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Fuchs looked at Max, raised his eyebrows and nodded across to
      Victor, who shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baby doesn&rsquo;t feel well,&rdquo; he said, feeding the brown dog with broken lumps
      of sugar, &ldquo;and nobody&rsquo;s to disturb him&mdash;I&rsquo;m nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever known him off colour,&rdquo; said Wistuba.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always imagined he had the better part of this world that could not
      be taken away from him. I think he says his prayers to the dear Lord for
      having spared him being taken home in seven basketsful to-night. It&rsquo;s a
      fool&rsquo;s game to risk your all that way and leave the nation desolate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dry up,&rdquo; said Max. &ldquo;You ought to be wheeled about on the snow in a
      perambulator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no offence, I hope. Don&rsquo;t get nasty.... How&rsquo;s your wife, Victor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not at all well. She hurt her head coming down the slide with Max
      on Sunday. I told her to stay at home all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. Are you other fellows going back to the town or stopping on
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fuchs and Victor said they were stopping&mdash;Max did not answer, but sat
      motionless while the men paid for their coffee and moved away. Victor came
      back a moment and put a hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going right back, my dear, I wish you&rsquo;d look Elsa up and tell
      her I won&rsquo;t be in till late. And feed with us to-night at Limpold, will
      you? And take some hot grog when you get in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, old fellow, I&rsquo;m all right. Going back now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, stretched himself, buttoned on his heavy coat and lighted another
      cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the door Victor watched him plunging through the heavy snow&mdash;head
      bent&mdash;hands thrust in his pockets&mdash;he almost appeared to be
      running through the heavy snow towards the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
     </p>
     <p>
      Someone came stamping up the stairs&mdash;paused at the door of her
      sitting-room, and knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Victor?&rdquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is I... can I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Why, what a Santa Claus! Hang your coat on the landing and
      shake yourself over the banisters. Had a good time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The room was full of light and warmth. Elsa, in a white velvet tea-gown,
      lay curled up on the sofa&mdash;a book of fashions on her lap, a box of
      creams beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtains were not yet drawn before the windows and a blue light shone
      through, and the white boughs of the trees sprayed across.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman&rsquo;s room&mdash;full of flowers and photographs and silk pillows&mdash;the
      floor smothered in rugs&mdash;an immense tiger-skin under the piano&mdash;just
      the head protruding&mdash;sleepily savage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was good enough,&rdquo; said Max. &ldquo;Victor can&rsquo;t be in till
      late. He told me to come up and tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started walking up and down&mdash;tore off his gloves and flung them on
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, Max,&rdquo; said Elsa, &ldquo;you get on my nerves. And I&rsquo;ve got a
      headache to-day; I&rsquo;m feverish and quite flushed.... Don&rsquo;t I look flushed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused by the window and glanced at her a moment over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you haven&rsquo;t looked at me properly, and I&rsquo;ve got a new tea-gown on,
      too.&rdquo; She pulled her skirts together and patted a little place on the
      couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along and sit by me and tell me why you&rsquo;re being naughty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, standing by the window, he suddenly flung his arm across his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m done&mdash;I&rsquo;m spent&mdash;I&rsquo;m smashed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence in the room. The fashion-book fell to the floor with a quick
      rustle of leaves. Elsa sat forward, her hands clasped in her lap; a
      strange light shone in her eyes, a red colour stained her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she spoke very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come over here and explain yourself. I don&rsquo;t know what on earth you are
      talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do know&mdash;you know far better than I. You&rsquo;ve simply played with
      Victor in my presence that I may feel worse. You&rsquo;ve tormented me&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      led me on&mdash;offering me everything and nothing at all. It&rsquo;s been a
      spider-and-fly business from first to last&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve never for one
      moment been ignorant of that&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve never for one moment been able
      to withstand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned round deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose that when you asked me to pin your flowers into your
      evening gown&mdash;when you let me come into your bedroom when Victor was
      out while you did your hair&mdash;when you pretended to be a baby and let
      me feed you with grapes&mdash;when you have run to me and searched in all
      my pockets for a cigarette&mdash;knowing perfectly well where they were
      kept&mdash;going through every pocket just the same&mdash;I knowing too&mdash;I
      keeping up the farce&mdash;do you suppose that now you have finally
      lighted your bonfire you are going to find it a peaceful and pleasant
      thing&mdash;you are going to prevent the whole house from burning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly turned white and drew in her breath sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me like that. You have no right to talk to me like that. I
      am another man&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; he sneered, throwing back his head, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s rather late in the
      game, and that&rsquo;s been your trump card all along. You only love Victor on
      the cat-and-cream principle&mdash;you a poor little starved kitten that
      he&rsquo;s given everything to, that he&rsquo;s carried in his breast, never dreaming
      that those little pink claws could tear out a man&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stirred, looking at him with almost fear in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all&rdquo;&mdash;unsteadily&mdash;&ldquo;this is my room; I&rsquo;ll have to ask you
      to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he stumbled towards her, knelt down by the couch, burying his head in
      her lap, clasping his arms round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I <i>love</i> you&mdash;I love you; the humiliation of it&mdash;I
      adore you. Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;just a minute let me stay
      here&mdash;just a moment in a whole life&mdash;Elsa! Elsa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leant back and pressed her head into the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his muffled voice: &ldquo;I feel like a savage. I want your whole body. I
      want to carry you away to a cave and love you until I kill you&mdash;you
      can&rsquo;t understand how a man feels. I kill myself when I see you&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      sick of my own strength that turns in upon itself, and dies, and rises new
      born like a Phoenix out of the ashes of that horrible death. Love me just
      this once, tell me a lie, <i>say</i> that you do&mdash;you are always lying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead, she pushed him away&mdash;frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;suppose the servant came in with the tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ye gods!&rdquo; He stumbled to his feet and stood staring down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re rotten to the core and so am I. But you&rsquo;re heathenishly
      beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman went over to the piano&mdash;stood there&mdash;striking one note&mdash;her
      brows drawn together. Then she shrugged her shoulders and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a confession. Every word you have said is true. I can&rsquo;t help
      it. I can&rsquo;t help seeking admiration any more than a cat can help going to
      people to be stroked. It&rsquo;s my nature. I&rsquo;m born out of my time. And yet,
      you know, I&rsquo;m not a <i>common</i> woman. I like men to adore me&mdash;to
      flatter me&mdash;even to make love to me&mdash;but I would never give myself to
      any man. I would never let a man kiss me... even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s immeasurably worse&mdash;you&rsquo;ve no legitimate excuse. Why, even a
      prostitute has a greater sense of generosity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know perfectly well&mdash;but I
      can&rsquo;t help the way I&rsquo;m built.... Are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put on his gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s going to happen to us now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea. I never have&mdash;just let things occur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;All alone?&rdquo; cried Victor. &ldquo;Has Max been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He only stayed a moment, and wouldn&rsquo;t even have tea. I sent him
      home to change his clothes.... He was frightfully boring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor darling, your hair&rsquo;s coming down. I&rsquo;ll fix it,
      stand still a moment... so you were bored?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-m&mdash;frightfully.... Oh, you&rsquo;ve run a hairpin right into your
      wife&rsquo;s head&mdash;you naughty boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung her arms round his neck and looked up at him, half laughing,
      like a beautiful, loving child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God! What a woman you are,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;You make me so infernally
      proud&mdash;dearest, that I... I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
